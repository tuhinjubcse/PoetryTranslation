Acid and sword blade: the fragrance
of plum in the pathways:
tooth’s sweetmeat of kisses,
power and spilth on the fingers,
the yielding erotic of pulps,
hayricks and threshing floors, clandestine
recesses that tempt through the vastness of houses;
bolsters asleep in the past, the bitter green valley,
seen from above, from the glasses’ concealment;
and drenching and flaring by turns, adolescence
like a lamp overturned in the rain.
Ailing in Vera Cruz, I remember
southern weather, weather
of the fleet fish in the heavens of water,
silvered, in my own country.
Loncoche, Lonquimay, Carahue, large on the summits,
circled by roots and serenities,
chaired upon platforms of rawhide and timber.
South is a stallion, submerging,
in the gradual trees and the dew, garlanded:
green muzzle poised, dropping water,
rump in the great archipelagoes, shadowed
and shimmering, ceremonial coal in his bowels.
Shade: will you never—finger and limb: will you never—
rivalries, portals and footfalls: are you never
to startle the jungles, the pathways and corn tassels,
mist, and cerulean cold that appoints you
the range of your wayfaring, endlessly vanishing?
Sky: conjure the day when I move in an orbit of stars,
trampling the lights and the powders, consuming my blood
till I nest in the eyrie of rain.
Permit that I pass
from the Toltén’s aroma of timber, from the tooth of the sawyer,
drenched to the footsoles, to enter the little cantinas.
Conduct me to light in the hazelnut’s voltage,
measure my length in the offal of cattle
to die and be born again, biting the germens.
Bring out of Ocean
a day of the South, grapple a day from your waves,
day of the watery tree: and summon the polar blue wind
to melt in the cold of my colors!
That time when I moved among happenings
in the midst of my mournful devotions; that time
when I cherished a leaflet of quartz,
at gaze in a lifetime’s vocation.
I ranged in the markets of avarice
where goodness is bought for a price, breathed
the insensate miasmas of envy, the inhuman
contention of masks and existences.
I endured in the bog-dweller’s element; the lily
that breaks on the water in a sudden
disturbance of bubbles and blossoms, devoured me.
Whatever the foot sought, the spirit deflected,
or sheered toward the fang of the pit.
So my poems took being, in travail
retrieved from the thorn, like a penance,
wrenched by a seizure of hands, out of solitude;
or they parted for burial
their secretest flower in immodesty’s garden.
Estranged to myself, like shadow on water,
that moves through a corridor’s fathoms,
I sped through the exile of each man’s existence,
this way and that, and so, to habitual loathing;
for I saw that their being was this: to stifle
one half of existence’s fullness like fish
in an alien limit of ocean. And there,
in immensity’s mire, I encountered their death;
Death grazing the barriers,
Death opening roadways and doorways.
I would know nothing, dream nothing:
who will teach my non-being
how to be, without striving to be?
How can the water endure it?
What sky have the stones dreamed?
Immobile, until those migrations
delay at their apogee
and fly on their arrows
toward the cold archipelago.
Unmoved in its secretive life,
like an underground city,
so the days may glide down
like ungraspable dew:
nothing fails, or shall perish,
until we be born again,
until all that lay plundered
be restored with the tread
of the springtime we buried—
the unceasingly stilled, as it lifts
itself out of non-being, even now,
to be flowering bough.
You in my twilight sky are like a cloud,
Your color and your shape are as I love them
You are mine, you are mine, dear sweet-lipped woman.
My endless dreams live on within your life.
My soul's lamp pours its dyes upon your feet
Sweeter on your lips is my bittered wine:
Oh harvester who reaps my evensong,
My solitary dreams so feel you mine!
You're mine, you're mine, I shout it to the evening
breeze, and the wind is off with my widowed voice.
Huntress of my eyes' depths, your plundering
Holds your nocturnal glance back, water-like.
You are caught in my music's net, my dear
love, and my music's nets are heaven-wide.
My soul's born on the shore of your mourning eyes.
And in your mourning eyes begins the land of dreams.
One time more, my love, the net of light extinguishes
work, wheels, flames, boredoms and farewells,
and we surrender the swaying wheat to night,
the wheat that noon stole from earth and light.
The moon alone in the midst of its clear page
sustains the pillars of Heaven’s Bay,
the room acquires the slowness of gold,
and your hands go here and there preparing night.
O love, O night. O cupola ringed by a river
of impenetrable water in the shadows of Heaven,
that raises and drowns its tempestuous orbs,
until we are only the one dark space
a glass into which fall celestial ashes,
one drop in the flow of a vast slow river.
Unclothed, you are true, like one of your hands,
lissome, terrestrial, slight, complete, translucent,
with curves of moon, and paths of apple-wood:
Unclothed you are as slender as a nude ear of corn.
Undressed you are blue as Cuban nights,
with tendrils and stars in your hair,
undressed you are wide and amber,
like summer in its chapel of gold.
Naked you are tiny as one of your fingertips,
shaped, subtle, reddening till light is born,
and you leave for the subterranean worlds,
as if down a deep tunnel of clothes and chores:
your brightness quells itself, quenches itself, strips itself down
turning, again, to being a naked hand.
The light that climbs from your feet to your hair,
the mantle enveloping your delicate form,
are not sea’s nacre, or frozen silver:
you are bread, bread, dear to the fire.
The grain built its silo around you, and rose,
increased by a golden age,
while its wheaten surge recreated your breasts,
my love was an ember labouring in earth.
Oh, bread of your forehead, your legs, and your mouth,
bread I consume, born each day with the light,
dear one, the bake-houses’ banner and sign:
the fire taught your blood its lessons,
you learnt sacredness from grain,
and your language, your perfume are bread.
I do not love you as if you were brine-rose, topaz,
or barbed carnations thrown off by the fire.
I love you as certain hidden things are loved,
secretly, between night and soul.
I love you like the flower-less plant
carrying inside itself the light of those flowers,
and, graced by your love, a fierce perfume
risen from earth, is alive, concealed in my flesh.
I love you without knowing how, whence, when.
I love you truly, without doubts, without pride,
I love you so, and know, no other way to love,
none but this mode of neither You nor I,
so close that your hand over my chest is my hand,
so close they are your eyes I shut when I sleep.
Lost in the woods, I snapped off a dark branch
and, lifted its murmur, in thirst, to my lips:
perhaps the weeping voice of the rain,
a shattered bell, or a broken heart.
It came to me, something out of far distance,
deeply concealed, and hidden by Earth,
a cry, defeated by immense autumns,
by half-opened moistness of shadowy leaves.
But waking out of the wood’s dream there,
that hazel branch sang under my tongue,
and its vagrant perfume rose to my mind
as if suddenly roots I had long abandoned
searched me, the lost domains of childhood,
and held me, wounded by wandering fragrance.
March days return with their covert light,      
and huge fish swim through the sky,
vague earthly vapours progress in secret,
things slip to silence one by one.
Through fortuity, at this crisis of errant skies,
you reunite the lives of the sea to that of fire,
grey lurchings of the ship of winter
to the form that love carved in the guitar.
O love, O rose soaked by mermaids and spume,
dancing flame that climbs the invisible stairway,
to waken the blood in insomnia’s labyrinth,
so that the waves can complete themselves in the sky,
the sea forget its cargoes and rages,
and the world fall into darkness’s nets.
Who ever desired each other as we do? Let us look
for the ancient ashes of hearts that burned,
and let our kisses touch there, one by one,
till the flower, disembodied, rises again.
Let us love that Desire that consumed its own fruit
and went down, aspect and power, into the earth:
We are its continuing light,
its indestructible, fragile seed.
That Desire, interred in time’s deep winter,
by snows and spring-times, absence and autumns,
bring to it the apple’s new light,
that freshness disclosed by a strange wound,
like that ancient Desire that journeys in silence
through submerged mouths’ eternities.
In the wave-strike over unquiet stones
the brightness bursts and bears the rose
and the ring of water contracts to a cluster
to one drop of azure brine that falls.
O magnolia radiance breaking in spume,
magnetic voyager whose death flowers
and returns, eternal, to being and nothingness:
shattered brine, dazzling leap of the ocean.
Merged, you and I, my love, seal the silence
while the sea destroys its continual forms,
collapses its turrets of wildness and whiteness,
because in the weft of those unseen garments
of headlong water, and perpetual sand,
we bear the sole, relentless tenderness.
Perhaps not to be is to be without your being,
without your going, that cuts noon light
like a blue flower, without your passing
later through fog and stones,
without the torch you lift in your hand
that others may not see as golden,
that perhaps no one believed blossomed
the glowing origin of the rose,
without, in the end, your being, your coming
suddenly, inspiringly, to know my life,
blaze of the rose-tree, wheat of the breeze:
and it follows that I am, because you are:
it follows from ‘you are’, that I am, and we:
and, because of love, you will, I will,We will, come to be.
Carnal apple, Woman filled, burning moon,
dark smell of seaweed, crush of mud and light,
what secret knowledge is clasped between your pillars?
What primal night does Man touch with his senses?
Ay, Love is a journey through waters and stars,
through suffocating air, sharp tempests of grain:
Love is a war of lightning,
and two bodies ruined by a single sweetness.
Kiss by kiss I cover your tiny infinity,
your margins, your rivers, your diminutive villages,
and a genital fire, transformed by delight,
slips through the narrow channels of blood
to precipitate a nocturnal carnation,
to be, and be nothing but light in the dark.
Tie your heart at night to mine, love,
and both will defeat the darkness
like twin drums beating in the forest
against the heavy wall of wet leaves.
Night crossing: black coal of dream
that cuts the thread of earthly orbs
with the punctuality of a headlong train
that pulls cold stone and shadow endlessly.
Love, because of it, tie me to a purer movement,
to the grip on life that beats in your breast,
with the wings of a submerged swan,
So that our dream might reply
to the sky’s questioning stars
with one key, one door closed to shadow.
You will recall the gorge of capricious waters
from which throbbing perfumes climbed,
and a bird, from time to time, clothed
with liquid slowness: winter plumage.
You will recall the gifts of the earth:
hot scents, clay of gold,
scrub grasses, mad roots,
bewitched thorns like swords.
You will recall the branch you bore,
branch of shadow and water of silence
branch like a stone of spume.
And that time was as never and always:
we go there where nothing does not await us,
and find all that is waiting there.
Oh love, oh mad light-beam, threat of violet,
you visit me, and climb, by your cool stairway
the tower that time has crowned with mist,
the ashen walls of an enclosed heart.
No one will know it was grace alone,
constructed crystals strong as citadels
and blood opened desolate tunnels
without its sovereignty dispelling winter.
So, love: your mouth, skin, light, sorrows,
were the bequest of life, the sacred
gifts of the rainfall, and of nature
that receives and lifts the weight of seed,
the hidden tumult of wine in casks,
the blaze of wheat under the ground.
From the archipelago you have hair of larch fibres,
flesh that was realised by aeons of time,
veins that have known oceans of timber,
green blood dropped from the sky into memory.
No one can recapture my heart, lost
among so many roots, in the bitter cool
of the sun’s rays multiplied by seething of waters:
there lives the shadow that does not depart with me.
So you rose out of the South like an islet,
crowned, populated, by plumage and timber,
and I sensed the fragrance of wandering woodland.
I found the dark honey I knew in the forest,
and touched at your hips the petals of shadow
that were born with me and that formed my soul.
The little girl made of timber didn’t arrive by walking:
there she was, all of a sudden, sitting among the cobbles,
ancient flowers, of the sea, were a coronet on her forehead,
her gaze was filled by deep rooted sadness.
There she rested, gazing, at our empty existence,
the doing, and being, and going, and coming, all over Earth,
and day was discolouring its measure of petals.
She watched us, without seeing, the girl-child of timber.
The girl-child who was crowned by the ancient waters,
sat there gazing, with eyes overwhelmed:
she knew we are living in a distant trawl-net,
of time, and water, and waves, and sounds, and rain,
and don’t know if we’re beings, or if we are her dreaming.
This is the fable of the girl who’s made of timber.
Not for the desert lands alone where the rock-salt
is like a rare rose, the flower interred by the sea,
my journey, but also for banks of rivers carving through snow.
The bitter heights of the Cordilleras knew my footsteps.
Sibilant, tangled, regions of my wild country,
creepers whose mortal kiss chains itself to the forest,
moist lament of the bird that surges up, shedding cool quavers:
oh, country of lost sorrows and pitiless tears!
Not only the poisonous skin of copper,
or the nitrate spread like a frieze, a snowy deposit,
but the vine, the cherry prized by the spring
are mine, and I belong like a dark atom
to the arid lands and the autumn light of the grape,
to this country of metal lifted in towers of snow.

Already, you are mine. Rest with your dream inside my dream.
Love, grief, labour, must sleep now.
Night revolves on invisible wheels
and joined to me you are pure as sleeping amber.
No one else will sleep with my dream, love.
You will go we will go joined by the waters of time.
No other one will travel the shadows with me,
only you, eternal nature, eternal sun, eternal moon.
Already your hands have opened their delicate fists
and let fall, without direction, their gentle signs,
you eyes enclosing themselves like two grey wings,
while I follow the waters you bring that take me onwards:
night, Earth, winds weave their fate, and already,
not only am I not without you, I alone am your dream.
O Southern Cross, O clover of scented phosphorus,
with four kisses this day penetrated your beauty
and traversed my hat and the shadows:
the moon went turning round a coldness.
Then, with my love, and my beloved, oh diamonds
of blue frost, serenity of Heaven,
mirror, you appeared, and night filled itself
with your four vaults of trembling wine.
O palpitating silver of fish, pure and polished,
emerald cross, parsley of the radiant shadows,
glow-worm nailed to the unity of Heaven,
rest in me, let us close our eyes, yours and mine.
Sleep with Man’s darkness for an instant.
Light, inside me, your four constellated numbers.
Day breaks: the whole of yesterday went falling
among fingers of light and eyes of dream,
tomorrow will arrive with green footsteps:
no one holds back the river of dawn.
No one holds back the river of your hands,
the eyes of your dream, beloved.
You are the tremor of time that runs
between light on end and darkened sunlight.
And the sky closes over you its wings
lifts you and brings you to my arms
with exact, mysterious courtesy.
For this I sing to the day and the moon,
to the sea, to time, to every planet,
to your diurnal voice, to your nocturnal flesh.
Through the mountains you pass like the breeze
or the sudden quickening that falls from the snow,
or your hair, throbbing with light, confirms
the high glittering of sun in the thicket.
All the light of the Caucasus falls on your body
as though into a little vase of glass, infinite,
where the water transforms itself, by dressing, by singing
at every transparent move of the river.
Through the mountains the ancient road of warriors
and below it seething, shines like a sword,
water between ramparts of mineral hands,
until you receive from the woods, in a moment,
the branch or lightning flash of some blue flower
and the unknown arrow of a wild fragrance.
It’s good to feel you are close to me in the night, love,
invisible in your sleep, intently nocturnal,
while I untangle my worries
as if they were twisted nets.
Withdrawn, your heart sails through dream,
but your body, relinquished so, breathes
seeking me without seeing me perfecting my dream
like a plant that seeds itself in the dark.
Rising, you will be that other, alive in the dawn,
but from the frontiers lost in the night,
from the presence and the absence where we meet ourselves,
something remains, drawing us into the light of life
as if the sign of the shadows had sealed
its secret creatures with flame.
Three birds of the ocean, three rays, three shears,
crossed the cold sky towards Antofagasta,
so that the air was left shivering,
everything shivered like a wounded flag.
Solitude, grant me the sign of your eternal origin,
the barest track of the cruel birds,
and the tremor that without doubt comes before
the honey, the music, the sea, the birth.
Solitude, sustained by a changeless face
like a heavy flower continually spreading
until it embraces the pure seethe of the sky.
They flew, cold wings of the ocean, of the Archipelago
towards the sand of Northeast Chile.
And the night bolted home its heavenly bolt.
Amor, Amor, the clouds in the sky’s tower
mounted like triumphant purifying fountains,
and all glowed blue, all was star-like:
sea, boat, day, fused and banished.
Come and see the cherries of water that appeared,
and the whole scale of the swift universe,
come and touch the fire of the blue instant,
come before its petals are consumed.
Nothing here lacks light, number, clusters,
space opened up by the wind’s virtues,
until it delivers the sea-foam’s last secret.
And among so many blues, celestial, submerged,
our eyes are lost barely divining
the powers of air, the underwater gushers.
The heavy rain of the south falls over Isla Negra
like a solitary drop transparent and weighty:
the sea opens its cool leaves to receive it:
the earth learns the wet fate of the glass.
My soul, grant me in your kisses the briny
water of these months, the honey of the region,
the fragrance moistened by the sky’s thousand lips,
the sacred patience of the sea in winter.
Something calls us: all the doors open by themselves,
the water tells a great story to the window-panes,
the sky extends down to touch the roots,
and like this the day weaves and unweaves its celestial net
with time, salt, murmurs, growth, pathways,
a woman, a man, and winter on the Earth.
My love, at the shutting of this door of night
I ask of you, love, a journey through a dark pound:
shut out your dreams: enter with your sky my eyes:
stretch out in my blood as if in a wide river.
Goodbye, goodbye, cruel clarity that was dropped
into the bag of every day of the past:
goodbye to every gleam of clocks or oranges:
welcome oh shadow, periodic friend!
In this boat, or water, or death, or new life,
one more time we unite, slumbering, resurrected:
we are the marriage of the night in the blood.
I don’t know who lives or dies, sleeps or wakes,
but it is your heart that delivers,
to my chest, the gifts of the dawn.
Misfortunes of the month of January when indifferent
noon establishes its equation in the sky,
a solid gold like wine in an overflowing glass
fills the earth to its blue limits.
Misfortunes of this time, appearing like tiny grapes
that bunch together in green bitterness,
confused, secret tears of the days,
until the elements divulge their clusters.
Yes, seeds, grief, everything that pulses
terrified, in the crackling light of January,
will ripen, ferment, as the fruit ferments.
The sorrows will be divided: the soul
give a gasp of air, and the dwelling-place
will be left clean, with fresh-made bread on the table.
And this word, this paper written
by the thousand hands of a single hand
does not rest in you, does not serve for dreams.
It falls to the earth: there it continues.
No matter that light or praise
were spilled and rose from the glass
if they were a tenacious tremor of wine,
if your mouth was dyed amaranthine.
It no longer needs the lagging syllable
that which the reef brings and withdraws
from my memories, the incensed spume,
It no longer needs a single thing but to write your name.
And even though my sombre love silences it
much later the spring will speak it.
At the centre of the Earth I’ll split apart
the emeralds to catch a sight of you
and you’ll be copying down the ears of wheat
like a message-taking plume of water.
What a world! What depths of parsley!
What a sailboat sailing in the sweetness!
And you perhaps and I perhaps of topaz!
There’ll be no more dissonance in the bells.
There’ll be no more than the free air,
the apples taken by the wind,
the juicy volume in among the branches,
and there where the carnations breathe
we will start a garment to last out
the eternity of a victorious kiss.
All those men were there inside,
when she came in totally naked.
They had been drinking: they began to spit.
Newly come from the river, she knew nothing.
She was a mermaid who had lost her way.
The insults flowed down her gleaming flesh.
Obscenities drowned her golden breasts.
Not knowing tears, she did not weep tears.
Not knowing clothes, she did not have clothes.
They blackened her with burnt corks and cigarette stubs,
and rolled around laughing on the tavern floor.
She did not speak because she had no speech.
Her eyes were the colour of distant love,
her twin arms were made of white topaz.
Her lips moved, silent, in a coral light,
and suddenly she went out by that door.
Entering the river she was cleaned,
shining like a white stone in the rain,
and without looking back she swam again
swam towards emptiness, swam towards death.
And it was at that age…Poetry arrived
in search of me. I don’t know, I don’t know where
it came from, from winter or a river.
I don’t know how or when,
no, they were not voices, they were not
words, nor silence,
but from a street I was summoned,
from the branches of night,
abruptly from the others,
among violent fires
or returning alone,
there I was without a face
and it touched me.
I did not know what to say, my mouth
had no way
with names
my eyes were blind,
and something started in my soul,
fever or forgotten wings,
and I made my own way,
deciphering
that fire
and I wrote the first faint line,
faint, without substance, pure
nonsense,
pure wisdom
of someone who knows nothing,
and suddenly I saw
the heavens
unfastened
and open,
planets,
palpitating plantations,
shadow perforated,
riddled
with arrows, fire and flowers,
the winding night, the universe.
And I, infinitesimal being,
drunk with the great starry
void,
likeness, image of
mystery,
I felt myself a pure part
of the abyss,
I wheeled with the stars,
my heart broke loose on the wind.
You ask what the crab offers, between its claws of gold,
and I say: The sea will tell you.
You ask what the sea-squirt hopes for in its translucent bell.What can it hope for?
I say that it waits on its time, as you do.
You question for whom the algal Macrocystis offers its embraces.
Unloose it, unloose it, in a certain ocean, and a certain time, that I know.
Though you turn, for my answer to the narwhal’s malicious ivory,I say that you wait for a darker reply,
how the sea-unicorn suffered the lance.
It may be you question the halcyon’s plumage,tremoring,
in the pure womb of the southern seas?
Now, on the crystalline house of the polyp you twine
new demands, threshing it to the husk?
You want to know the matter electric, caught on the forks of the deep?
The stalactite’s armour that extends as crystal?
The spear of the angler-fish, the music stretched-out
in the gulf, like a thread amongst waters?
I say to you that the ocean knows it, the life
of its circlings vast as the sands, pure and innumerable,
and between the red vine-clusters, time has brightened
the stone of the petals, the light of medusas,
and the branches are threshed in the web of the corals,
from the flowing horn’s infinite nacre.
I am the empty net that hangs,
beyond men, rendered dead by the shadowy waters,
fingers grown used to the triangle, measured
by the shy hemisphere of orange-flowers.
I came, like you, penetrating
the interminable starlight,
in the net of the self, in the night, and found naked self, 
the sole catch, the fish noosed in the wind.
With chaste heart, and pure
eyes
I celebrate you, my beauty,
restraining my blood
so that the line
surges and follows
your contour,
and you bed yourself in my verse,
as in woodland, or wave-spume:
earth's perfume,
sea's music.
Nakedly beautiful,
whether it is your feet, arching
at a primal touch
of sound or breeze,
or your ears,
tiny spiral shells
from the splendour of America's oceans.
Your breasts also,
of equal fullness, overflowing
with the living light
and, yes,
winged
your eyelids of silken corn
that disclose
or enclose
the deep twin landscapes of your eyes.
The line of your back
separating you
falls away into paler regions
then surges
to the smooth hemispheres
of an apple,
and goes splitting
your loveliness
into two pillars
of burnt gold, pure alabaster,
to be lost in the twin clusters of your feet,
from which, once more, lifts and takes fire
the double tree of your symmetry:
flower of fire, open circle of candles,
swollen fruit raised
over the meeting of earth and ocean.
Your body - from what substances
agate, quartz, ears of wheat,
did it flow, was it gathered,
rising like bread
in the warmth,
and signalling hills
silvered,
valleys of a single petal, sweetnesses
of velvet depth,
until the pure, fine, form of woman
thickened and rested there
It is not so much light that falls
over the world
extended by your body
its suffocating snow,
as brightness, pouring itself out of you,
as if you were
burning inside.
Under your skin the moon is alive.
Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
Write, for example, “The night is starry
and the blue stars shiver in the distance.”
The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.
Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.
Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.
She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too.
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.
Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.
To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.
What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
The night is starry and she is not with me.
This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.
My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.
The same night whitening the same trees.
We, of that time, are no longer the same.
I no longer love her, that’s certain, but how I loved her.
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.
Another’s. She will be another’s. As she was before my kisses.
Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.
I no longer love her, that’s certain, but maybe I love her.
Love is so short, forgetting is so long.
Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.
Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that I write for her.
Leaning into the afternoon, I cast my saddened nets,
towards your oceanic eyes.
There, in the highest fire, my solitude unrolls and ignites,
arms flailing like a drowning man’s.
I send out crimson flares across your distant eyes,
that swell like the waves, at the base of a lighthouse.
You only guard darkness, far-off woman of mine,
from your gaze the shore of trepidation sometimes emerges.
Leaning towards afternoon, I fling my saddened nets,
into the sea, your eyes of ocean trouble.
The night-birds peck at the early stars,
that glitter as my soul does, while it loves you.
The night gallops, on its mare of shadows,
spilling blue silken tassels of corn, over the fields.
This day, Today, was a brimming glass.
This day, Today, was an immense wave.
This day was all the Earth.
This day, the storm-driven ocean
lifted us up in a kiss
so exalted we trembled
at the lightning flash
and bound as one, fell,
and drowned, without being unbound.
This day our bodies grew
stretched out to Earth’s limits,
orbited there, melded there
to one globe of wax, or a meteor’s flame.
A strange door opened, between us,
and someone, with no face as yet,
waited for us there.
When your hands leap
towards mine, love,
what do they bring me in flight?
Why did they stop
at my lips, so suddenly,
why do I know them,
as if once before,
I have touched them,
as if, before being,
they travelled
my forehead, my waist?
Their smoothness came
winging through time,
over the sea and the smoke,
over the Spring,
and when you laid
your hands on my chest
I knew those wings
of the gold doves,
I knew that clay,
and that colour of grain.
The years of my life
have been roadways of searching,
a climbing of stairs,
a crossing of reefs.
Trains hurled me onwards
waters recalled me,
on the surface of grapes
it seemed that I touched you.
Wood, of a sudden,
made contact with you,
the almond-tree summoned
your hidden smoothness,
until both your hands
closed on my chest,
like a pair of wings
ending their flight.
Victory. It has come late, I had not learnt
how to arrive, like the lily, at will,
the white figure, that pierces
the motionless eternity of earth,
pushing at clear, faint, form,
till the hour strikes: that clay,
with a white ray, or a spur of milk.
Shedding of clothing, the thick darkness of soil,
on whose cliff 
the fair flower advances,
till the flag of its whiteness
defeats the contemptible deeps of night,
and, from the motion of light,
spills itself in astonished seed.
I like you calm, as if you were absent,
and you hear me far-off, and my voice does not touch you.
It seems that your eyelids have taken to flying:
it seems that a kiss has sealed up your mouth.
Since all these things are filled with my spirit,
you come from things, filled with my spirit.
You appear as my soul, as the butterfly’s dreaming,
and you appear as Sadness’s word.
I like you calm, as if you were distant,
you are a moaning, a butterfly’s cooing.
You hear me far-off, my voice does not reach you.
Let me be calmed, then, calmed by your silence.
Let me commune, then, commune with your silence,
clear as a light, and pure as a ring.
You are like night, calmed, constellated.
Your silence is star-like, as distant, as true.
I like you calm, as if you were absent:
distant and saddened, as if you were dead.
One word at that moment, a smile, is sufficient.
And I thrill, then, I thrill: that it cannot be so.
So that you will hear me
my words
sometimes grow thin
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches.
Necklace, drunken bell
for your hands as smooth as grapes.
And I watch my words from a long way off.
They are more yours than mine.
They climb on my old suffering ivy.
It climbs the same way on damp walls.
You are to blame for this cruel sport.
They are fleeing from my dark lair.
You fill everything, you fill everything.
Before you they are peopled in the solitude that you occupy, 
and they are more used to my sadness than you are.
Now I want them to say what I want to say to you
and to make you hear as I wasn’t you to hear me.
The winds of anguish still hauls on them as usual.
Sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over.
You listen to other voices in my painful voice
Lament of old mouths, blood of old supplications.
Love me, companion. Don’t forsake me. Follow me.
Follow me, companion, on this wave of anguish.
But my words become stained with your love.
You occupy everything, you occupy everything.
I am making them into an endless necklace
for your white hands, smooth as grapes.
Lake Budi, sombre, dark heavy stone,
unburied water between high forest,
there you opened, like a subterranean door,
near the solitary sea at the end of the Earth.
We galloped over the infinite sands
joined to the flowing richness of spume,
not a house, not a man, not a horse,
only time going by, and that green and white shore,
that ocean.
Then towards hills, and, of a sudden,
the lake, a solid, secretive water,
compact light, gem of an earthly ring.
A flight, white and black: swans being banished,
long necks of nocturnal darkness, webs of scarlet skin,
and the clear snow flying over the world.
O flight from water’s meaning,
thousand bodies destined to beauty unshaken
like the lake’s pellucid permanence.
Suddenly, the whole, was a rush over water,
motion, sound, turrets of full moon,
and then wild wings making order from whirlwind,
a grandeur, flying, a beating,
and then, absence, white tremor of void.
Comes a time I’m tired of being a man.
Comes a time I check out the tailor’s or the movies
shriveled, impenetrable, like a felt swan
wafted on waters of origin and ashes.
A whiff from the pubs has me sobbing my eyes out.
All I want is a break from rocks and wool,
all I want is to see neither buildings nor gardens,
no shopping centers no glasses no elevators.
Comes a time I’m tired of my feet and my fingernails
and my hair and my shadow.
Comes a time I’m tired of being a man.
Yet how delicious it would be
to shock a notary with a cut lily
or to kill off a nun with a blow to the ear.
How beautiful
to run through the streets with a green knife,
howling until I died of cold.
I don’t want to go on like a root in the shadows,
hesitating, pushing forward, trembling with dream,
down down into the dipped tripe of the earth,
soaking it up and thinking, eating every day.
I don’t want for myself so many misfortunes.
I don’t want to keep on as root and tomb,
alone, subterranean, in a vault stuffed with corpses,
frozen stiff, dying of grief.
That’s why Monday burns like kerosene
when it sees me show up with my mugshot face,
and it shrieks on its way like a wounded wheel,
trailing hot bloody footprints into the night.
And it shoves me into certain corners, certain damp houses,
into hospitals where bones sail out the window,
into certain shoestores reeking of vinegar,
into streets godawful as crevices.
There are brimstone-colored birds and horrible intestines
adorning the doors of houses I hate,
there are dentures dropped into a coffeepot,
mirrors
that must have bawled with shame and terror,
there are umbrellas everywhere, poisons and belly buttons.
I pass by with serenity, with eyes, with shoes,
with fury and forgetting,
I go cruising the offices and orthopedic stores,
and patios where clothes hang from a wire
where underwear, towels and blouses cry
drawn out, obscene tears.
The word was born in the blood,
it grew in the dark body, pulsing,
and took flight with the lips and mouth.
Farther away and nearer,
still, still it came
from dead fathers and from wandering races,
from territories that had become stone,
that had tired of their poor tribes,
because when grief set out on the road
the people went and arrived
and united new land and water
to sow their word once again.
And that's why the inheritance is this:
this is the air that connects us
with the buried man and with the dawn
of new beings that haven't yet arisen.
Still the atmosphere trembles
with the first word
produced
with panic and groaning.
It emerged
from the darkness
and even now there is no thunder
that thunders with the iron sound
of that word,
the first
word uttered:
perhaps it was just a whisper, a raindrop,
but its cascade still falls and falls.
Later on, meaning fills the word.
It stayed pregnant and was filled with lives,
everything was births and sounds:
affirmation, clarity, strength,
negation, destruction, death:
the name took on all the powers
and combined existence with essence
in its electric beauty.
Human word, syllable, flank
of long light and hard silver,
hereditary goblet that receives
the communications of the blood:
it is here that silence was formed by
the whole of the human word
and not to speak is to die among beings:
language extends out to the hair,
the mouth speaks without moving the lips:
suddenly the eyes are words.
I take the word and move through it,
as if it were only a human form,
its lines delight me and I sail
in each resonance of language:
I utter and I am and across the boundary of words,
without speaking, I approach silence.
I drink to the word, raising
a word or crystalline cup,
in it I drink
the wine of language
or unfathomable water,
maternal source of all words,
and cup and water and wine
give rise to my song
because the name is origin
and green life: it is blood,
the blood that expresses its substance,
and thus its unrolling is prepared:
words give crystal to the crystal,
blood to the blood,
and give life to life.
Mondays are meshed with Tuesdays
and the week with the whole year.
Time cannot be cut
with your weary scissors,
and all the names of the day
are washed out by the waters of night.
No one can claim the name of Pedro,
nobody is Rosa or Maria,
all of us are dust or sand,
all of us are rain under rain.
They have spoken to me of Venezuelas,
of Chiles and of Paraguays;
I have no idea what they are saying.
I know only the skin of the earth
and I know it is without a name.
When I lived amongst the roots
they pleased me more than flowers did,
and when I spoke to a stone
it rang like a bell.
It is so long, the spring
which goes on all winter.
Time lost its shoes.
A year is four centuries.
When I sleep every night,
what am I called or not called?
And when I wake, who am I
if I was not while I slept?
This means to say that scarcely
have we landed into life
than we come as if new-born;
let us not fill our mouths
with so many faltering names,
with so many sad formallities,
with so many pompous letters,
with so much of yours and mine,
with so much of signing of papers.
I have a mind to confuse things,
unite them, bring them to birth,
mix them up, undress them,
until the light of the world
has the oneness of the ocean,
a generous, vast wholeness,
a crepitant fragrance.
Every morning you wait,
clothes, over a chair,
to fill yourself with
my vanity, my love,
my hope, my body.
Barely
risen from sleep,
I relinquish the water,
enter your sleeves,
my legs look for
the hollows of your legs,
and so embraced
by your indefatigable faithfulness
I rise, to tread the grass,
enter poetry,
consider through the windows,
the things,
the men, the women,
the deeds and the fights
go on forming me,
go on making me face things
working my hands,
opening my eyes,
using my mouth,
and so,
clothes,
I too go forming you,
extending your elbows,
snapping your threads,
and so your life expands
in the image of my life.
In the wind
you billow and snap
as if you were my soul,
at bad times
you cling
to my bones,
vacant, for the night,
darkness, sleep
populate with their phantoms
your wings and mine.
I wonder
if one day
a bullet
from the enemy
will leave you stained with my blood
and then
you will die with me
or one day
not quite
so dramatic
but simple,
you will fall ill,
clothes,
with me,
grow old
with me, with my body
and joined
we will enter
the earth.
Because of this
each day
I greet you
with reverence and then
you embrace me and I forget you,
because we are one
and we will go on
facing the wind, in the night,
the streets or the fight,
a single body,
one day, one day, some day, still.
You are going to ask: and where are the lilacs?
and the poppy-petalled metaphysics ?
and the rain repeatedly spattering
its words and drilling them full
of apertures and birds?'
I’ll tell you all the news.
I lived in a suburb,
a suburb of Madrid, with bells,
and clocks and trees.
From there you could look out
Over Castille’s dry face:               
a leather ocean.    
My house was called
the house of flowers, because in every cranny
geraniums burst: it was
a good-looking house
with its dogs and children.
Remember, Raúl?
Eh, Rafael?
Federico, do you remember
from under the ground
Do you remember my house with balconies
where the light of June drowned flowers in your mouth?
Brother, my brother!
Everything
loud with big voices, the salt of merchandises,
pile-ups of palpitating bread,
the stalls of my suburb of Argüelles with its statue
Like a drained inkwell in a swirl of hake:
oil flowed into spoons,
a deep baying
of feet and hands swelled in the streets,
metres, litres, the sharp
measure of life,
stacked-up fish,
the texture of roofs with a cold sun in which
the weather vane falters,
the fine, frenzied ivory of potatoes,
wave on wave of tomatoes rolling down to the sea.
And one morning all that was burning,
one morning the bonfires
leapt out of the earth
devouring human beings -
and from then on fire,
gunpowder from then on,
and from then on blood.
Bandits with planes and Moors,
Bandits with finger-rings and duchesses,
Bandits with black friars spattering blessings
came through the sky to kill children
and the blood of children ran through the streets
without fuss, like children's blood.
Jackals that the jackals would despise,
stones that the dry thistle would bite on and spit out,
vipers that the vipers would abominate!
Face to face with you I have seen the blood
of Spain tower like a tide
to drown you in one wave
of pride and knives!
Treacherous
generals:
see my dead house,
look at broken Spain:
from every house burning metal flows
instead of flowers,
from every socket of Spain
Spain emerges
and from every dead child a rifle with eyes,
and from every crime bullets are bom
which will one day find
the bull's eye of your hearts.
And you will ask: why doesn’t his poetry
speak of dreams and leaves
and the great volcanoes of his native land?
Come and see the blood in the streets.
Come and see
the blood in the streets.
Come and see the blood
in the streets!
Turn me oh sun
towards my native destiny,
rain from the ancient forest,
return to me the fragrance and the swords
that fall from the sky,
the solitary peace of field and rock,
the moisture at the margins of the river,
the scent of the larch,
the wind, alive like a heart
beating among the remote flock
of the great araucaria.
Earth, return to me your pure gifts
the towers of silence that rose
from the solemnity of their roots:
I want to return to being what I have not been,
learn to return from such depths
that amongst all the things of nature
I could live or not live: no matter
to be one more stone, the dark stone,
the pure stone that is carried by the river.
The gay young men and the love-sick girls,
and the abandoned widows suffering in sleepless delirium,
and the young pregnant wives of thirty hours,
and the raucous cats that cruise my garden in the shadows,
like a necklace of pulsating oysters of sex
surround my lonely residence,
like enemies lined up against my soul,
like conspirators in bedroom clothes
who exchange long deep kisses to order.
The radiant summer leads to lovers
in predictable melancholic regiments,
made of fat and skinny, sad and happy pairings:
under the elegant coconut palms, near the ocean and the moon,
goes an endless movement of trousers and dresses,
a whisper of silk stockings being caressed,
and women’s breasts that sparkle like eyes.
The little employee, after it all,
after the week’s boredom, and novels read by night in bed,
has definitively seduced the girl next door,
and carried her away to a run-down movie house
where the heroes are studs or princes mad with passion,
and strokes her legs covered with soft down
with his moist and ardent hands that smell of cigarettes.
The seducer’s afternoons and married peoples’ nights
come together like the sheets and bury me,
and the hours after lunch when the young male students
and the young girl students, and the priests, masturbate,
and the creatures fornicate outright,
and the bees smell of blood, and the flies madly buzz,
and boy and girl cousins play oddly together,
and doctors stare in fury at the young patient’s husband,
and the morning hours in which the professor, as if to pass the time,
performs his marriage duties, and breakfasts,
and moreover, the adulterers, who love each other truly
on beds as high and deep as ocean liners:
finally, eternally surrounding me
is a gigantic forest breathing and tangled
with gigantic flowers like mouths with teeth
and black roots in the shape of hooves and shoes.
The roadway
is full of tomatoes,
midday,
summer,
the light
splits itself
in two
halves
of tomato,
runs
down the roads
as juice.
In December
it goes wild
the tomato,
invades
kitchens,
infiltrates lunches,
settles itself
quietly
on sideboards,
among glasses,
butter-dishes,
blue salt-shakers.
It has
its own light,
gentle authority.
Sadly we have to
murder it:
sinking,
the knife
in its living pulp,
it is a red
heart,
a fresh
sun,
deep,
inexhaustible,
filling the salads
of Chile,
is happily wedded
to the clear onion,
and to celebrate
oil
lets itself
pour,
essential
child of the olive,
over its half-open hemispheres,
the peppers
add
their fragrance,
salt its magnetism:
it’s a stylish
wedding,
parsley
lifts
little flags,
the potatoes
boil with vigour,
the roast
knocks
on the door
with its aroma,
it’s time!
come on!
and on to
the table, in the middle
of summer,
the tomato,
earth-star,
star
repeated
and fecund,
shows us
its convolutions,
its channels,
the famous fullness
and plenty
delivers up
without stone
without rind
without scales or spines
the gift
of its fiery colour
and the whole of its freshness.
From the sands of Magellan we salvaged you, exhausted
voyager, immobile
beneath the storm your sweet twofold breast so many times
defied dividing itself between your nipples.
We lifted you again over the Southern waters, but now
you were the passenger in darkness, of angles, one
with the wheat and the metal you guarded
on the wide water, enveloped by oceanic night.
Today you are mine, goddess whom the giant albatross
grazed with its wingspan extended in flight,
like a cloak of music conducted in rain
by your blind wandering eyelids of timber.
Rose of the sea, bee more pure than dream,
almond-woman who from the roots
of a holm-oak peopled with cantos
made yourself form, force of the nest-filled foliage,
mouth of tempests, delicate sweetness,
that could go conquering the light with its thighs.
When the angels and the queens born with you,
covering themselves with moss, slumbered, fated
to the immobility the dead guard with honour,
you climbed to the narrow prow of the ship
and angel and queen and wave, you were the earth’s tremor.
Man’s shudderings climbed to your
noble tunic with its apple-wood breast.
while your lips oh sweetness! were moistened
by other kisses worthy of your wild mouth.
Beneath strange nights your waist let
fall the pure burden of the ship into the waves
cutting a path through the sombre extent
of overturned flame, of phosphorescent honey.
The wind opened its bag of tempests,
the unbound metal of its groans,
and the light at dawn received you trembling
in the ports, kissing your moist diadem.
Sometimes the trembling vessel heeled
when you halted your path through the sea,
like a heavy fruit that breaks off and falls,
a dead mariner whom the spume,
and the pure motion of time and ship, receive.
And you alone among all the faces
submerged by menace, plunged into barren sadness,
received the scattered salt-brine on your mask,
and your eyes retained the salty tears.
More than one wretched life slipped from your arms
into an eternity of funereal waters,
and the touch of the dead and the living
wore away your heart of ocean timber.
Today we have salvaged your form from the sand.
Finally you were destined for my eyes.
You slumber, perhaps, a slumberer, perhaps you are dead, a dead one:
your motion has finally forgotten the sighing
and the wandering splendour has ceased its journey.
Anger of ocean, blows of the heavens have circled
your proud head with cracks and fissures,
and your face rests like a conch,
with wounds that mark your swaying brow.
For me your beauty holds all of the perfume,
all of the wandering corrosion, all its dark night.
And in your raised breast of lamp or of goddess,
swelling turret, immobile love, life lives.
Salvaged, you sail with me, until that day
in which they let fall what I am into the spume.
I grew, drenched by nature’s waters,
like a mollusk in ocean phosphor:
in me shattered brine reverberated,
and laid down my proper skeleton.
How to explain? Almost without movement
of azure and bitter breath,
one by one the waves repeated
what I gave out, and throbbed,
till brine and juice formed me:
the disdain, the desire of a wave,
the green rhythm that from the hidden bulk
lifted up a translucent edifice,
that secret, it clasped to itself, and so
I sensed that I might pulse as it did:
that my song might grow with the waters.
I recall that man and not two centuries
have passed since I saw him,
he went neither by horse nor by carriage:
purely on foot
he outstripped
distances,
and carried no sword or armour,
only nets on his shoulder,
axe or hammer or spade,
never fighting the rest of his species:
his exploits were with water and earth,
with wheat so that it turned into bread,
with giant trees to render them wood,
with walls to open up doors,
with sand to construct the walls,
and with ocean for it to bear.
I knew him and he is still not cancelled in me.
The carriages fell to pieces,
war destroyed doors and walls,
the city was a handful of ashes,
all the clothes turned to dust,
and he remains to me,
he survives in the sand,
when everything before
seemed imperishable but him.
In the going and coming of families
at times he was my father or kinsman
or perhaps it was scarcely him or not
the one who did not return to his house
because water or earth swallowed him up
or a tree or an engine killed him,
or he was the saddened carpenter
who went behind the coffin, without tears,
someone in the end who had no name,
except those that metal or timber have,
and on whom others gazed from on high
without seeing the ant
for the anthill
and so that when his feet did not stir,
because the poor exhausted one had died,
they never saw what they had not seen:
already there were other feet where he’d been.
The other feet were still his,
and the other hands,
the man remained:
when it seemed that now he was done for
he was the same once more,
there he was digging again at the earth,
cutting cloth, minus a shirt,
there he was and was not, like before,
he had gone down and was once more,
and since he never owned graveyards,
or tombs, nor  was his name carved
on the stone he sweated to quarry,
no one knew he had come
and no one knew when he died,
so that only when the poor man could
he returned to life once more, without it being noted.
He was the man, no doubt of it, without heritage,
without cattle, without a flag,
and he was not distinguished from others,
the others who were him,
from the heights he was grey like the subsoil,
tanned like the leather,
he was yellow reaping the wheat,
he was black down in the mine,
he was the colour of stone on the fortress,
in the fishing boat the colour of tuna,
and the colour of horses in the meadow:
how could anyone distinguish him
if he was inseparable, elemental,
earth, coal or sea vested in man?
Where he lived whatever
a man touched grew:
the hostile stones,
quarried
by his hands,
took on order
and one by one formed
the right clarity of a building,
he made bread with his hands,
moved the engines,
the distances peopled themselves with towns,
other men grew,
bees arrived,
and by man’s creating and breeding
spring walked the market squares
between bakeries and doves.
The maker of loaves was forgotten,
he who quarried and journeyed, beating down
and opening furrows, transporting sand,
when everything existed he no longer existed,
he gave his existence, that’s all.
He went elsewhere to labour, and at last
he was dead, rolling
like a stone in the river:
death carried him downstream.
I, who knew him, saw him descend
till he was no longer except what he left:
roads he could scarcely know,
houses he never ever would live in.
I turn to see him, and I await him
I see him in his grave and resurrected.
I distinguish him among all
who are his equals
and it seems to me it cannot be,
that like this we go nowhere,
that to survive like this holds no glory.
I believe that this man
must be enthroned, rightly shod and crowned.
I believe that those who made such things
must be the masters of all these things.
And that those who made bread should eat!
And those in the mines must have light!
Enough now of grey men enslaved!
Enough of the pale ‘missing ones’!
Not another man passes except as a king.
Not a single woman without her crown.
Golden gauntlets for every hand.
Fruits of the sun for all the unknowns!
I knew that man and when I could,
when he still had eyes in his head,
when he still had a voice in his mouth
I searched for him among tombs, and I said
grasping his arm that was not yet dust:
‘All will be gone, you will live on,
You ignite life.
You made what is yours.’
So let no one trouble themselves when
I seem to be alone and am not alone,
I am with no one and speak for them all:
Some listen to me, without knowing,
but those I sing, those who do know
go on being born, and will fill up the Earth.
Ink that entrances me
drop by drop
and goes guarding the trail
of my reason and unreason
like a large scar that’s barely
seen when the body’s asleep
in its discourse of dissolution.
Better perhaps if
all your essence
were to have emptied in one drop
and thrown itself on a single page
stained it with a single green star
and that only that stain
were to have been all
I had written in the whole of my life,
without alphabet or interpretations:
a single dark stroke
without words.
What it takes on this planet
to love each other in peace:
all the world examines the sheets,
all of them trouble your love.
And they say terrible things
about a man and a woman
who, after lots of vacillations,
and lots of deliberations,
do something incomparable,
fall together into one bed.
I ask myself if the frogs
stake out, sneeze at, themselves,
whether they whisper in ponds
against the outlaw frogs
against the joy of spawn.
I ask myself if the birds
make bird enemies
and if the bull listens to oxen
before he pays court to the cows.
Now the streets have eyes,
the parks have police,
the hotels have their spys,
the windows note down names,
troops and guns are sent out
resolute against love,
working incessantly
the throats and the ears,
and a guy and his girl
are forced to burst into flower
while fleeing on a bike.
From the North Almagro brought his train of scintillations.
And over the territories, between explosion and subsidence,
he bent himself day and night as if over a map.
Shadow of thorns, shadow of thistle and wax,
the Spaniard joined to his dry shape,
gazed at the ground’s sombre strategies.
Night, snow and sand make up the form of
my narrow country,
all the silence is in its long line,
all the foam rises from its sea beard
all the coal fills it with mysterious kisses.
Like a hot coal the gold burns in its fingers,
and the silver lights like a green moon
its hardened form of a gloomy planet.
The Spaniard seated next to the rose one day,
next to the oil, next to the wine, next to the ancient sky,
did not conceive of this place of furious stone
being born from under the ordure of the sea eagle.
Night sea, statue of white and green
I love you: sleep with me. I travelled all
the roads, calcined and dying,
nature grew with me, Man
overcame his ashes, prepared himself
for rest, surrounded by the Earth.
Night fell so that your eyes
could not see his miserable slumber:
needing nearness, he opened his arms
protected by beings and walls,
and fell into the sleep of silence, sinking
with his roots into the funereal earth.
I, night ocean, to your open form,
to your expanse that Aldebaran guards,
to the wet mouth of your song
came with the love that builds me.
I saw you, night of the sea, when you were born
beaten into infinite nacre:
I watched the starry threads woven,
and the electricity at your waist,
and the blue motion of the sounds
that hound your devoured sweetness.
Love me without love, flagrant wife.
Love me with space, with the river
of your breathing, with the increase
of all your overflowing diamonds:
love me without respite from your aspect,
grant me the honesty of your breakers.
Beautiful, you are, beloved night, beautiful:
you keep the tempest like a bee
slumbering among your agitated stamens,
dream and water tremble in the hollows
of your breasts, harassed by slopes.
Nocturnal love, I followed what you raised,
your eternity, the trembling tower
that assumes the stars, the measure
of your wavering, the villages
that the spume raises on your flanks:
I am fastened to your throat
and to the lips that you bruise on the sand.
Who are you? Night of the seas, tell me
whether your heights of hair cover
all solitude, whether it is infinite
this space of blood and prairies.
Tell me who you are, full of boats,
full of moons the wind crushes,
mistress of all metals, rose
of the depths, rose drenched
by the harsh weather of naked love.
Earth’s tunic, green statue,
grant me a wave like a bell,
grant me a wave of furious orange blossom,
the crowd of bonfires, the boats
of the sky’s capital, the water where I sail
the crowds of celestial fire. I want one
moment of expansiveness, and more than
all dreams, your remoteness:
all the purples you measure, your grave
pensive, constellated system:
all your hair touched
by darkness, and the dawn you prepare.
I want to contain your simultaneous brow,
unfurling it within me, to be born
on all your shores, to go now
with all the secrets breathed,
with your shadow lines kept safe
in me like blood or flags,
carrying these secret measures
to the sea of every day, to the battles
in every gateway —loves and threats—
that live slumbering.
But then
I will enter the city with as many eyes
as you, and I will bear the garment
with which you invested me, and may I be moved
to the furthest reaches of measureless water:
by purity and rage against every deathliness,
remoteness that cannot be exhausted, music
for those who slumber and those who wake.
For the sun’s pure power, I write, for the full sea,
for the full and open road, wherever I can I sing,
only the vagrant night detains me
but I gain space in that interruption,
I gain shadow for lengths of time.
Night’s black wheat grows
while my eyes measure the field.
I forge keys from dawn to dusk:
I search for locks in the darkness
and I go throwing open ruined gates to the sea
until the wardrobes are full of foam.
I never tire of going and returning,
death does not stop me with its stone,
I never tire of presence and absence.
Sometimes I ask myself if it was from
my father or my mother or the mountains
I inherited these mineral tasks,
veins of a burning ocean,
and I know I go on, and go on to go on,
and I sing to sing on, and to sing.
Nothing explains what happens
when I close my eyes and circle
as if between two undersea channels,
one lifts me up to die in its branches
and the other sings so I might sing.
So then, I am composed of absence
and akin to the sea that assaults the reef
with its briny globules of whiteness
and takes back the stone into the wave.
So that whatever of death surrounds me
opens in me the window on life
and in the full paroxysm I am sleeping.
To the full light I go on through the shadow.
I have appointed you queen.
There are greater women than you, greater.
There are purer women than you, purer.
There are more beautiful women than you, there are.
But you are the queen.
When you walk through the streets
no one recognises you.
No one sees your crystal crown, no one notices
the carpet of red gold
you tread as you pass,
the carpet that does not exist.
And when you appear
all the rivers roar
in my body, bells
shake the heavens,
and the world is filled with a hymn.
Only you and I,
only you and I, my love,
only we hear it.
How long does a man live, after all?
Does he live a thousand days, or one only?
A week, or several centuries?
How long does a man spend dying?
What does it mean to say 'for ever'?
Lost in these preoccupation
I set myself to clear things up.
I sought out knowledgeable priests.
I waited for them after their rituals,
I watched them when they went their ways
to visit God and the Devil.
They wearied of my questions.
They on their part knew very little;
they were no more than administrators.
Medical men received me
in between consultations,
a scalpel in each hand,
saturated in aureomycin,
busier each day.
As far as I could tell from their talk,
the problem was as follows:
it was not so much the death of a microbe —
they went down by the ton —
-but the few which survived
showeds signs of perversity.
They left me so startled
that I sought out the gravediggers.
I went to the rivers where they burn
enormous painted corpses,
tiny bony bodies,
emperors with an aura
of terrible curses,
women snuffed out at a stroke
by a wave of cholera.
There were whole beaches of dead
and ashy specialists.
When I got the chance
I asked them a slew of questions.
They offered to burn me;
it was the only thing they knew.
In my own country the undertakers
answered me, between drinks:
'Get yourself a good woman
and give up this nonsense.'
I never saw people so happy.
Raising their glasses they sang,
toasting health and death.
They were huge fornicators.
I returned home, much older
after crossing the world.
Now I question nobody.
But I know less every day.
Leave me alone with the day.
I ask for permission to be born.
I know that my outline will be tranquil
in the north-wind of a sky without reflections,
mercury of watching, chaste mirror
where the pulse of my spirit is broken.
Because if ivy and the coolness of linen
are the law of the body I leave behind,
my outline in the sand will be the ancient
unembarrassed silence of the crocodile.
And though my tongue of frozen doves
will never hold the flavour of flame,
only the lost taste of broom,
Ill be the free mark of oppressed laws
on the neck of the stiff branch
and on the endless aching dahlias.
I want the river to lose its way.
I want the wind to quit the valley.
I want the night to lose its sight,
and my heart its flower of gold;
the cattle to speak to the great leaves,
and the worm to die of shadows;
the teeth on the skull to shine,
and the silk to be drowned in yellows.
I can see wounded midnights duel
struggling, knotted, with noon light.
I resist the broken arch, where time suffers,
and the green venom of twilight.
But do not make a black cactus,
open in reeds, of your nakedness.
Leave me afraid of dark planets,
but do not show me your calm waist.
I want no more than a hand,
A wounded hand, if possible.
I want no more than a hand,
even if I spend a thousand nights with no bed.
It would be a pale lily of lime,
a dove it would be, chained to my heart,
the guard it would be, who on my last night
would deny the moon entrance wholly.
I want no more than that hand
for daily unction, the white sheet of my dying.
I want no more than that hand
to bear a wing of my death.
All the rest passes.
Blush now without a name. Perpetual star.
The rest is the other; sad breeze,
While the hosts of leaves flee.
The night is coming.
The moonlight strikes
on evenings anvil.
The night is coming.
A giant tree clothes itself
in the leaves of cantos.
The night is coming.
If you came to see me,
on the path of storm-winds....
The night is coming.
....you would find me crying,
under high, black poplars.
Ay, girl with the dark hair!
Under high, black poplars.
So I took her to the river
thinking she was virgin,
but it seems she had a husband.
It was the night of Saint Iago,
and it almost was a duty.
The lamps went out,
the crickets lit up.
By the last street corners
I touched her sleeping breasts,
and they suddenly had opened
like the hyacinth petals.
The starch
of her slip crackled
in my ears like silk fragments
ripped apart by ten daggers.
The tree crowns
free of silver light are larger,
and a horizon, of dogs, howls
far away from the river.
Past the hawthorns,
the reeds, and the brambles,
below her dome of hair
I made a hollow in the sand.
I took off my tie.
She took of a garment.
I my belt with my revolver.
She four bodices.
Creamy tuberoses
or shells are not as smooth as
her skin was, or, in the moonlight,
crystals shining brilliantly.
Her thighs slipped from me
like fish that are startled,
one half full of fire,
one half full of coldness.
That night I galloped
on the best of roadways,
on a mare of nacre,
without stirrups, without bridle.
As a man I cannot tell you
the things she said to me.
The light of understanding
has made me most discreet.
Smeared with sand and kisses,
I took her from the river.
The blades of the lilies
were fighting with the air.
I behaved as what I am,
as a true gypsy.
I gave her a sewing basket,
big, with straw-coloured satin.
I did not want to love her,
for though she had a husband,
she said she was a virgin
when I took her to the river.
Virgin in a crinoline,
Virgin of Solitude,
spreading immensely
like a tulip-flower.
In your boat of light,
go
through the high seas
of the city.
through turbulent singing,
through crystalline stars.
Virgin in a crinoline
through the roadways river
you go,
down to the sea!
To see you naked is to know the Earth.
The Earth glistening, empty of horses.
The Earth, reed-less, pure in form,
closed to futures, horizon of silver.
To see you naked is to see the concern
of rain searching for a fragile waist,
or the feverish seas immense face,
not finding its own brightness.
Blood will cry in the alcoves,
enter with swords on fire,
but you will not know the cache,
of the toads heart or the violet.
Your belly is a knot of roots,
your lips a dawn with no outline.
Under the beds cool roses,
the dead moan, waiting their turn.
Green, as I love you, greenly.
Green the wind, and green the branches.
The dark ship on the sea
and the horse on the mountain.
With her waist that’s made of shadow
dreaming on the high veranda,
green the flesh, and green the tresses,
with eyes of frozen silver.
Green, as I love you, greenly.
Beneath the moon of the gypsies
silent things are looking at her
things she cannot see.
Green, as I love you, greenly.
Great stars of white hoarfrost
come with the fish of shadow
opening the road of morning.
The fig tree’s rubbing on the dawn wind
with the rasping of its branches,
and the mountain thieving-cat-like
bristles with its sour agaves.
Who is coming? And from where...?
She waits on the high veranda,
green the flesh and green the tresses,
dreaming of the bitter ocean.
—‘Brother, friend, I want to barter
your house for my stallion,
sell my saddle for your mirror,
change my dagger for your blanket.
Brother mine, I come here bleeding
from the mountain pass of Cabra.’
—‘If I could, my young friend,
then maybe we’d strike a bargain,
but I am no longer I,
nor is this house, of mine, mine.’
—‘Brother, friend, I want to die now,
in the fitness of my own bed,
made of iron, if it can be,
with its sheets of finest cambric.
Can you see the wound I carry
from my throat to my heart?’
—‘Three hundred red roses
your white shirt now carries.
Your blood stinks and oozes,
all around your scarlet sashes.
But I am no longer I,
nor is this house of mine, mine.’
—‘Let me then, at least, climb up there,
up towards the high verandas.
Let me climb, let me climb there,
up towards the green verandas.
High verandas of the moonlight,
where I hear the sound of waters.’
Now they climb, the two companions,
up there to the high veranda,
letting fall a trail of blood drops,
letting fall a trail of tears.
On the morning rooftops,
trembled, the small tin lanterns.
A thousand tambourines of crystal
wounded the light of daybreak.
Green, as I love you, greenly.
Green the wind, and green the branches.
They climbed up, the two companions.
In the mouth, the dark breezes
left there a strange flavour,
of gall, and mint, and sweet-basil.
—‘Brother, friend! Where is she, tell me,
where is she, your bitter beauty?
How often, she waited for you!
How often, she would have waited,
cool the face, and dark the tresses,
on this green veranda!’
Over the cistern’s surface
the gypsy girl was rocking.
Green the flesh is, green the tresses,
with eyes of frozen silver.
An ice-ray made of moonlight
holding her above the water.
How intimate the night became,
like a little, hidden plaza.
Drunken Civil Guards were beating,
beating, beating on the door frame.
Green, as I love you, greenly.
Green the wind, and green the branches.
The dark ship on the sea,
and the horse on the mountain.
The remanso of air
under the branch of echo.
The remanso of water
under a frond of stars.
The remanso of your mouth
under a thicket of kisses.
A rose in the high garden that you desire.
A wheel in the pure syntax of steel.
The mountain stripped of impressionist mist.
Greys looking out from the last balustrades.
Modern painters in their blank studios,
Sever the square root’s sterilized flower.
In the Seine’s flood an iceberg of marble
freezes the windows and scatters the ivy.
Man treads the paved streets firmly.
Crystals hide from reflections’ magic.
Government has closed the perfume shops.
The machine beats out its binary rhythm.
An absence of forests, screens and brows
Wanders the roof-tiles of ancient houses.
The air polishes its prism on the sea
and the horizon looms like a vast aqueduct.
Marines ignorant of wine and half-light,
decapitate sirens on seas of lead.
Night, black statue of prudence, holds
the moon’s round mirror in  her hand.
A desire for form and limit conquers us.
Here comes the man who sees with a yellow ruler.
Venus is a white still life
and the butterfly collectors flee.
Cadaqués, the fulcrum of water and hill,
lifts flights of steps and hides seashells.
Wooden flutes pacify the air.
An old god of the woods gives children fruit.
Her fishermen slumber, dreamless, on sand.
On the deep, a rose serves as their compass.
The virgin horizon of wounded handkerchiefs,
unites the vast crystals of fish and moon.
A hard diadem of white brigantines
wreathes bitter brows and hair of sand.
The sirens convince, but fail to beguile,
and appear if we show a glass of fresh water.
Oh Salvador Dalí, of the olive voice!
I don’t praise your imperfect adolescent brush
or your pigments that circle those of your age,
I salute your yearning for bounded eternity.
Healthy soul, you live on fresh marble.
You flee the dark wood of improbable forms.
Your fantasy reaches as far as your hands,
and you savor the sea’s sonnet at your window.
The world holds dull half-light and disorder,
in the foreground humanity frequents.
But now the stars, concealing landscapes,
mark out the perfect scheme of their courses.
The flow of time forms pools, gains order,
in the measured forms of age upon age.
And conquered Death, trembling, takes refuge
in the straightened circle of the present moment.
Taking your palette, its wing holds a bullet-hole,
you summon the light that revives the olive-tree.
Broad light of Minerva, builder of scaffolding,
with no room for dream and its inexact flower.
You summon the light that rests on the brow,
not reaching the mouth or the heart of man.
Light feared by the trailing vines of Bacchus,
and the blind force driving the falling water.
You do well to place warning flags
on the dark frontier that shines with night.
As a painter you don’t wish your forms softened
by the shifting cotton of unforeseen clouds.
The fish in its bowl and the bird in its cage.
You refuse to invent them in sea or in air.
You stylize or copy once you have seen,
with your honest eyes, their small agile bodies.
You love a matter defined and exact,
where the lichen cannot set up its camp.
You love architecture built on the absent,
admitting the banner merely in jest.
The steel compass speaks its short flexible verse.
Now unknown islands deny the sphere.
The straight line speaks of its upward fight
and learned crystals sing their geometry.
Yet  the rose too in the garden where you live.
Ever the rose, ever, our north and south!
Calm, intense like an eyeless statue,
blind to the underground struggle it causes.
Pure rose that frees from artifice, sketches,
and opens for us the slight wings of a smile.
(Pinned butterfly that muses in flight.)
Rose of pure balance not seeking pain.
Ever the rose!
Oh Salvador Dalí of the olive voice!
I speak of what you and your paintings tell me.
I don’t praise your imperfect adolescent brush,
but I sing the firm aim of your arrows.
I sing your sweet battle of Catalan lights,
your love of what might be explained.
I sing your heart astronomical, tender,
a deck of French cards, and never wounded.
I sing longing for statues, sought without rest,
your fear of emotions that wait in the street.
I sing the tiny sea-siren who sings to you
riding a bicycle of corals and conches.
But above all I sing a shared thought
that joins us in the dark and the golden hours.
It is not Art, this light that blinds our eyes.
Rather it is love, friendship, the clashing of swords.
Rather than the picture you patiently trace,
it’s the breast of Theresa, she of insomniac skin,
the tight curls of Mathilde the ungrateful,
our friendship a board-game brightly painted.
May the tracks of fingers in blood on gold
stripe the heart of eternal Catalonia.
May stars like fists without falcons shine on you,
while your art and your life burst into flower.
Don’t watch the water-clock with membranous wings,
nor the harsh scythe of the allegories.
Forever clothe and bare your brush in the air
before the sea peopled with boats and sailors.
A lovely reed-like boy,
wide shoulders, slim waist,
skin of nocturnal apple-trees,
sad mouth and large eyes,
with nerves of hot silver,
walks the empty street.
His shoes of leather
crush the dahlias of air,
in a double-rhythm beating out
quick celestial dirges.
On the margins of the sea
theres no palm-tree his equal,
no crowned emperor,
no bright wandering star.
When his head bends down
over his breast of jasper,
the night seeks out the plains,
because it needs to kneel.
The guitars sound only
for Saint Gabriel the Archangel,
tamer of pale moths,
and enemy of willows.
Saint Gabriel: the child cries
in his mothers womb.
Dont forget the gypsies
gifted you your costume.
Royal Annunciation,
sweetly moonlit and poorly clothed
opens the door to the starlight
that comes along the street.
The Archangel Saint Gabriel
scion of the Giralda tower,
came to pay a visit,
between a lily and a smile.
In his embroidered waistcoat
hidden crickets throbbed.
The stars of the night
turned into bells.
Saint Gabriel: Here am I
with three nails of joy.
Your jasmine radiance folds
around my flushed cheeks.
God save you, Annunciation.
Dark-haired girl of wonder.
Youll have a child more beautiful
than the stems of the breeze.
Ah, Saint Gabriel, joy of my eyes!
Little Gabriel my darling!
I dream a chair of carnations
for you to sit on.
God save you, Annunciation,
sweetly moonlit and poorly clothed.
Your child will have on his breast
a mole and three scars.
Ah, Saint Gabriel, how you shine!
Little Gabriel my darling!
In the depths of my breasts
warm milk already wells.
God save you, Annunciation.
Mother of a hundred houses.
Your eyes shine with arid
landscapes of horsemen.
In amazed Annunciations
womb, the child sings.
Three bunches of green almond
quiver in his little voice.
Now Saint Gabriel climbed
a ladder through the air.
The stars in the night
turned to immortelles.
Death
enters, and leaves,
the tavern.
Black horses
and sinister people
travel the deep roads
of the guitar.
And theres a smell of salt
and of female blood
in the fevered tuberoses
of the shore.
Death
enters and leaves,
and leaves and enters
the death
of the tavern.
Each afternoon in Granada
each afternoon, a child dies.
Each afternoon the water sits down
and chats with its companions.
The dead wear mossy wings.
The cloudy wind and the clear wind
are two pheasants in flight through the towers,
and  the day is a wounded boy.
Not a flicker of lark was left in the air
when I met you in the caverns of wine.
Not the crumb of a cloud was left in the ground
when you were drowned in the river.
A giant of water fell down over the hills,
and the valley was tumbling with lilies and dogs.
In my hands' violet shadow, your body,
dead on the bank, was an angel of coldness.
Dont let me ever lose the wonder
of your eyes like a statues, or the stress
placed on my cheek at night.
by the solitary rose of your breath.
Im afraid of being on this shore
a branch-less trunk: this deepest feeling
of having no bloom, or pulp, or clay
for the worm of my suffering.
If youre my hidden treasure,
if youre my cross, and my moist pain,
if Im a dog, of yours, my master,
never let me lose what I have gained,
and decorate the branches of your stream
with the leaves of my enraptured autumn.
For Dámaso Alonso
Preciosa comes playing
her moon of parchment
on an amphibious path
of crystals and laurels.
The silence without stars
fleeing from the sound,
falls to the sea that pounds and sings,
its night filled with fish.
On the peaks of the sierra
the carabineers are sleeping
guarding the white turrets
where the English live.
And the gypsies of the water
build, to amuse themselves,
bowers, out of snails
and twigs of green pine.
 *
Preciosa comes playing
her moon of parchment.
Seeing her, the wind rises,
the one that never sleeps.
Saint Christopher, naked
full of celestial tongues
gazes at the child playing
a sweet distracted piping.
—Child, let me lift your dress
so that I can see you.
Open the blue rose of your womb
with my ancient fingers.
Preciosa hurls her tambourine
and runs without stopping.
The man-in-the-wind pursues her
with a burning sword.
The sea gathers its murmurs.
The olive-trees whiten.
The flutes of the shadows sound,
and the smooth gong of the snow.
Run, Preciosa, run,
lest the green wind catch you!
Run, Preciosa, run!
See where he comes!
The satyr of pale stars
with his shining tongues.
Preciosa, full of fear,
way beyond the pines,
enters the house that belongs,
to the English Consul.
Alarmed at her cries
three carabineers come,
their black capes belted,
and their caps over their brows.
The Englishman gives the gypsy girl
a glass of lukewarm milk,
and a cup of gin that
Preciosa does not drink.
And while, with tears, she tells
those people of her ordeal,
the angry wind bites the air
above the roofs of slate.
When the moon has risen full
I’m off to Santiago, Cuba,
in a wagon of black water.
Singing palms above the roof-tops.
When the palm-tree wants to be stork,
And the banana-tree jellyfish,
with the blond head of Fonseca.
With the rose, Juliet’s and Romeo’s,
Oh, Cuba! Oh, rhythm of dried seeds!
Oh, waist of fire, drop of wood!
Harp of living tree-trunks. Caiman. Flower of tobacco.
I always said I’d be off, off to Santiago,
in a wagon of black water.
Air and alcohol on the wheels,
My coral in the twilight,
The ocean drowned in the sand,
Heat whitening, fruit rotting,
Oh, the sugar-cane’s dumb coolness!
Oh, Cuba, curve of sigh and clay!
Just your hot heart,
nothing more.
My Paradise, a field,
no nightingales,
no strings,
a river, discrete,
and a little fountain.
Without the spurs,
of the wind, in the branches,
without the star,
that wants to be leaf.
An enormous light
that will be
the glow
of the Other,
in a field of 
broken gazes.
A still calm
where our kisses,
sonorous circles
of echoes,
will open, far-off.
And your hot heart,
nothing more.
A calvary,
on the naked hillside.
Clear water.
Centenarian olives.
Through the narrow alleys,
men with cloaks on,
and on turrets,
wind-vanes, circling.
Eternally
rotating.
O lost pueblo,
in Andalusia of sorrows!
For José Moreno Villa
Silence of lime and myrtle.
Mallows in slenders grasses.
The nun embroiders wallflowers
on a straw-coloured cloth.
In the chandelier, fly
seven prismatic birds.
The church grunts in the distance
like a bear belly upwards.
How she sews! With what grace!
On the straw-coloured cloth
she wants to embroider
the flowers of her fantasy.
What sunflowers! What magnolias
of sequins and ribbons!
What crocuses and moons
on the cloth over the altar!
Five grapefruit sweeten
in the nearby kitchen.
The five wounds-of-Christ
cut in Almería.
Through the eyes of the nun
two horsemen gallop.
A last quiet murmur
takes off her camisole.
And gazing at clouds and hills
in the strict distance,
her heart of sugar
and verbena breaks.
Oh what a high plain
with twenty suns above it!
What standing rivers
her fantasy sees setting!
But she goes on with her flowers,
while standing, in the breeze,
the light plays chess
high in the lattice-window.
If I am dying,
leave the balcony open.
The child is eating an orange.
(From my balcony, I see him.)
The reaper is reaping the barley.
(From my balcony, I hear him.)
If I am dying,
leave the balcony open.
By the river banks
the night is wetting itself
and on Lolitas breasts
the branches die of love.
The branches die of love.
The naked night sings
over the March bridgeheads.
Lolita washes her body
with brine and tuberoses.
The branches die of love.
The night of aniseed and silver
shines on the rooftops.
Silver of streams and mirrors.
Aniseed of your white thighs.
The branches die of love.
To Diego Buigas de Dalmáu
They are seen from the verandahs
on the mountain, mountain, mountain,
mules and mules shadows
weighed down with sunflowers.
Their eyes in the shadows
are dulled by immense night.
Salt-laden dawn rustles
in the corners of the breeze.
A sky of white mules
closes its reflective eyes,
granting the quiet half-light
a heart-filled ending.
And the water turns cold
so no-one touches it.
Water maddened and exposed
on the mountain, mountain, mountain.
Saint Michael, covered in lace,
shows his lovely thighs,
in his tower room,
encircled by lanterns.
The Archangel, domesticated,
in the twelve-o-clock gesture,
pretends to a sweet anger
of plumage and nightingales.
Saint Michael sings in the glass,
effeminate one, of three thousand nights,
fragrant with eau de cologne,
and far from the flowers.
The sea dances on the sands,
a poem of balconies.
The shores of the moonlight
lose reeds, gain voices.
Field-hands are coming
eating sunflower seeds,
backsides large and dark
like planets of copper.
Tall gentlemen come by
and ladies with sad deportment,
dark-haired with nostalgia
for a past of nightingales.
And the Bishop of Manila,
blind with saffron, and poor,
speaks a two-sided mass
for the women and the men.
Saint Michael is motionless
in the bedroom of his tower,
his petticoats encrusted
with spangles and brocades.
Saint Michael, king of globes,
and odd numbers,
in the Berberesque delicacy
of cries and windowed balconies.
The beaks of cockerels dig,
searching for the dawn,
when down the dark hill
comes Soledad Montoya.
Her skin of yellow copper
smells of horse and shadow.
Her breasts, like smoky anvils,
howl round-songs.
‘Soledad, who do you ask for
alone, at this hour?’
‘I ask for who I ask for,
say, what is it to you?
I come seeking what I seek,
my happiness and my self.’
‘Soledad of my regrets,
the mare that runs away
meets the sea at last
and is swallowed by the waves.’
‘Don’t recall the sea to me
for black sorrow wells
in the lands of olive-trees
beneath the murmur of leaves.’
‘Soledad, what sorrow you have!
What sorrow, so pitiful!
You cry lemon juice
sour from waiting, and your lips.’
‘What sorrow, so great! I run
through my house like a madwoman,
my two braids trailing on the floor,
from the kitchen to the bedroom.
What sorrow! I show clothes
and flesh made of jet.
Ay, my linen shifts!
Ay, my thighs of poppy!
‘Soledad: bathe your body
with the skylarks’ water
and let your heart be
at peace, Soledad Montoya.’
Down below the river sings:
flight of sky and leaves.
The new light crowns itself
with pumpkin flowers.
O sorrow of the gypsies!
Sorrow, pure and always lonely.
Oh sorrow of the dark river-bed
and the far dawn!
For Conchita García Lorca
The moon came to the forge
in her bustle of spikenard.
The child looks and looks.
The child is looking at her.
In the sympathetic air
the moon waves her arms
and discloses,lewd and chaste,
her breasts of hard tin.
Run away, moon, moon, moon!
If the gypsies should come,
they would make from your heart
white necklaces and white rings.
Child, let me go on dancing.
When the gypsies come
they will find you on the anvil
with your littles eyes closed.
Run away, moon, moon, moon!
for already I hear their horses.
Child, let me alone, do not step
on my starched whiteness.
The horseman was approaching,
beating the drum of the plain.
Inside of the forge,
the child's eyes are closed
Through the olive grove came,
bronze and dream, the gypsies.
Their heads lifted upright
and their eyes half closed.
Oh, how the owl is hooting,
oh, how it hoots inthe tree!
The moon goes through the sky
with a child by the hand.
The gypsies inside the forge,
are weeping, crying loudly.
The air watches and watches.
The air is watching it.
To Juan Guerrero,Cónsul general de la Poesía
The horses are black.
The horseshoes are black.
Stains of ink and wax
shine on their capes.
They have leaden skulls
so they do not cry.
With souls of leather
they ride down the road.
Hunchbacked and nocturnal
wherever they move, they command
silences of dark rubber
and fears of fine sand.
They pass, if they wish to pass,
and hidden in their heads
is a vague astronomy
of indefinite pistols.
Oh city of the gypsies!
Banners on street-corners.
The moon and the pumpkin
with preserved cherries.
Oh city of the gypsies!
Who could see you and not remember?
City of sorrow and musk,
with towers of cinnamon.
When night came near,
night that night deepened,
the gypsies at their forges
beat out suns and arrows.
A badly wounded stallion
knocked against all the doors.
Roosters of glass were crowing
through Jerez de la Frontera.
Naked the wind turns
the corner of surprise,
in the night silver-night
night the night deepened.
The Virgin and Saint Joseph
have lost their castanets,
and search for the gypsies
to see if they can find them.
The Virgin comes draped
in the mayoresss dress,
of chocolate papers
with necklaces of almonds.
Saint Joseph swings his arms
under a cloak of silk.
Behind comes Pedro Domecq
with three sultans of Persia.
The half moon dreamed
an ecstasy of storks.
Banners and lanterns
invaded the flat roofs.
Through the mirrors wept
ballerinas without hips.
Water and shadow, shadow and water
through Jerez de la Frontera.
Oh city of the gypsies!
Banners on street-corners.
Quench your green lamps
the worthies are coming.
Oh city of the gypsies!
Who could see you and not remember?
Leave her far from the sea
without combs in her hair.
They ride two abreast
towards the festive city.
A murmur of immortelles
invades the cartridge-belts.
They ride two abreast.
A doubled nocturne of cloth.
They fancy the sky to be
a showcase for spurs.
The city, free from fear,
multiplied its doors.
Forty civil guards
enter them to plunder.
The clocks came to a halt,
and the cognac in the bottles
disguised itself as November
so as not to raise suspicion.
A flight of intense shrieks
rose from the weathercocks.
The sabres chopped at the breezes
that the hooves trampled.
Along the streets of shadow
old gypsy women ran,
with the drowsy horses,
and the jars of coins.
Through the steep streets
sinister cloaks climb,
leaving behind them
whirlwinds of scissors.
At a gate to Bethlehem
the gypsies congregate.
Saint Joseph, wounded everywhere,
shrouds a young girl.
Stubborn rifles crack
sounding in the night.
The Virgin heals children
with spittle from a star.
But the Civil Guard
advance, sowing flames,
where young and naked
imagination is burnt out.
Rosa of the Camborios
moans in her doorway,
with her two severed breasts
lying on a tray.
And other girls ran
chased by their tresses
through air where roses
of black gunpowder burst.
When all the roofs
were furrows in the earth
the dawn heaved its shoulders
in a vast silhouette of stone.
O city of the gypsies!
The Civil Guard depart
through a tunnel of silence
while flames surround you.
O city of the gypsies!
Who could see you and not remember?
Let them find you on my forehead:
a play of moon and sand.
To Rafael Méndez
Halfway down the steep ravine
blades from Albacete,
lovely with the other's blood,
are glistening like fish.
Against the bitter green,
a card-hard light
traces raging horses
and riders' silhouettes.
Sitting in an olive tree,
two old women weep.
The bull of the dispute
is driven up the walls.
Black angels were bringing
handkerchiefs and melted snow.
Angels with enormous wings
of blades from Albacete.
Juan Antonio from Montilla
tumbles down the incline, dead,
irises across his body,
a pomegranate in his head.
Now he rides a flaming cross
along the road of death.
The judge comes through the olive grove
with the Civil Guard.
The seeped-out blood is moaning
mute song of the serpent.
Civil Guardsmen, Sirs,
it was just the usual thing:
four Romans dead
and five Carthaginians.
The afternoon, gone mad
with figs and heated sounds,
swoons and falls upon
the riders' wounded thighs.
Black angels were flying
on the western breeze.
Angels with long braids
and hearts of soothing oil.
I looked at myself in your eyes
Thinking about your soul.
White oleander.
I looked at myself in your eyes
Thinking about your mouth.
Red oleander.
I looked at myself in your eyes
But you were dead!
Black oleander.
I want to descend the well,
I want to climb the walls of Granada,
To gaze at the heart graved
By the dark stylus of waters.
The wounded child moaned
With a crown of frost.
Ponds, cisterns and fountains
Raised their swords in the air.
Ay what fury of love, what a wounding edge,
what nocturnal murmurs, what white deaths!
What deserts of light went destroying
the sand-dunes of dawn!
The child was alone
With the sleeping town in his throat.
A fountain that rises from dream
guarded him from thirsts of seaweed.
The child and his agony face to face,
Were two green entangled showers.
The child stretched on the ground
his agony bent on itself.
I want to descend the well,
I want to die my death by mouthfuls,
I want to fill my heart with moss,
To see the one wounded by water.
To Claudio Guillén
Through the laurel branches
I saw two doves of darkness.
The one it was the sun,
the other one was lunar.
I said: Little neighbours
where is my tombstone?
In my tail-feathers, the sun said.
In my throat, said the lunar.
And I who was out walking
with the earth wrapped round me,
saw two eagles made of white snow,
and a girl who was naked.
And the one was the other,
and the girl, she was neither.
I said: Little eagles,
where is my tombstone?
In my tail-feathers, the sun said.
In my throat, said the lunar.
Through the branches of laurel,
I saw two doves, both naked.
And the one was the other,
and the two of them were neither.
By the East River and the Bronx
boys sang, stripped to the waist,
along with the wheels, oil, leather and hammers.
Ninety thousand miners working silver from rock
and the children drawing stairways and perspectives.
But none of them slumbered,
none of them wished to be river,
none loved the vast leaves,
none the blue tongue of the shore.
By East River and the Queensboro
boys battled with Industry,
and Jews sold the river faun
the rose of circumcision
and the sky poured, through bridges and rooftops,
herds of bison driven by the wind.
But none would stop,
none of them longed to be cloud,
none searched for ferns
or the tambourine’s yellow circuit.
When the moon sails out
pulleys will turn to trouble the sky;
a boundary of needles will fence in memory
and coffins will carry off those who don’t work.
New York of mud,
New York of wire and death.
What angel lies hidden in your cheek?
What perfect voice will speak the truth of wheat?
Who the terrible dream of your stained anemones?
Not for a single moment, Walt Whitman, lovely old man,
have I ceased to see your beard filled with butterflies,
nor your corduroy shoulders frayed by the moon,
nor your thighs of virgin Apollo,
nor your voice like a column of ash;
ancient beautiful as the mist,
who moaned as a bird does
its sex pierced by a needle.
Enemy of the satyr,
enemy of the vine
and lover of the body under rough cloth.
Not for a single moment, virile beauty
who in mountains of coal, billboards, railroads,
dreamed of being a river and slumbering like a river
with that comrade who would set in your breast
the small grief of an ignorant leopard.
Not for a single moment, Adam of blood, Male,
man alone on the sea, Walt Whitman, lovely old man,
because on penthouse roofs,
and gathered together in bars,
emerging in squads from the sewers,
trembling between the legs of chauffeurs
or spinning on dance-floors of absinthe,
the maricas, Walt Whitman, point to you.
Him too! He’s one! And they hurl themselves
at your beard luminous and chaste,
blonds from the north, blacks from the sands,
multitudes with howls and gestures,
like cats and like snakes,
the maricas, Walt Whitman, maricas,
disordered with tears, flesh for the whip,
for the boot, or the tamer’s bite.
Him too! He’s one! Stained fingers
point to the shore of your dream,
when a friend eats your apple,
with its slight tang of petrol,
and the sun sings in the navels
of the boys at play beneath bridges.
But you never sought scratched eyes,
nor the darkest swamp where they drown the children,
nor the frozen saliva,
nor the curved wounds like a toad’s belly
that maricas bear, in cars and on terraces,
while the moon whips them on terror’s street-corners.
You sought a nakedness like a river.
Bull and dream that would join the wheel to the seaweed,
father of your agony, camellia of your death,
and moan in the flames of your hidden equator.
For it’s right that a man not seek his delight
in the bloody jungle of approaching morning.
The sky has shores where life is avoided
and bodies that should not be echoed by dawn.
Agony, agony, dream, ferment and dream.
This is the world, my friend, agony, agony.
Bodies dissolve beneath city clocks,
war passes weeping with a million grey rats,
the rich give their darlings
little bright dying things,
and life is not noble, or sacred, or good.
Man can, if he wishes, lead his desire
through a vein of coral or a heavenly nude.
Tomorrow loves will be stones and Time
a breeze that comes slumbering through the branches.
That’s why I don’t raise my voice, old Walt Whitman,
against the boy who inscribes
the name of a girl on his pillow,
nor the lad who dresses as a bride
in the shadow of the wardrobe,
nor the solitary men in clubs
who drink with disgust prostitution’s waters,
nor against the men with the green glance
who love men and burn their lips in silence.
But yes, against you, city maricas,
of tumescent flesh and unclean thought.
Mothers of mud. Harpies. Unsleeping enemies
of Love that bestows garlands of joy.
Against you forever, you who give boys
drops of foul death with bitter poison.
Against you forever,
Fairies of North America,
Pájaros of Havana,
Jotos of Mexico,
Sarasas of Cádiz,
Apios of Seville,
Cancos of Madrid,
Floras of Alicante,
Adelaidas of Portugal.
Maricas of all the world, murderers of doves!
Slaves to women. Their boudoir bitches.
Spread in public squares like fevered fans
or ambushed in stiff landscapes of hemlock.
No quarter! Death
flows from your eyes
and heaps grey flowers at the swamp’s edge.
No quarter! Look out!!
Let the perplexed, the pure,
the classical, noted, the supplicants
close the gates of the bacchanal to you.
And you, lovely Walt Whitman, sleep on the banks of the Hudson
with your beard towards the pole and your hands open.
Bland clay or snow, your tongue is calling
for comrades to guard your disembodied gazelle.
Sleep: nothing remains.
A dance of walls stirs the prairies
and America drown itself in machines and lament.
I long for a fierce wind that from deepest night
shall blow the flowers and letters from the vault where you sleep
and a negro boy to tell the whites and their gold
that the kingdom of wheat has arrived.Under the Elvira arch
let me see you pass
that I may learn your name
and cry.
What pale moon at nine
bled your cheek white?
Who gathers up the seed
that sets its snow aflame?
What tiny cactus spike
shatters your glass?
Under the Elvira arch
let me see you pass
that I may lap your eyes
and cry.
How it chastens me,
the market-call you raise!
What odd carnation, you,
amid the piles of wheat!
How far you are when close!
How near to me when gone!
Under the Elvira arch
let me see you pass
that I may suffer your thighs
and cry.
The field
of olives
like a fan,
opens, and closes.
Over the olives,
deep sky,
and dark rain,
of frozen stars.
Reeds, and blackness,
tremble, by the river.
Grey air shivers.
The olives
are full of cries.
A crowd
of imprisoned birds,
moving long tails
in shadow.
In Vienna there are ten little girls,
a shoulder for death to cry on,
and a forest of dried pigeons.
There is a fragment of tomorrow
in the museum of winter frost.
There is a thousand-windowed dance hall.
Ay, ay, ay, ay!
Take this close-mouthed waltz.
Little waltz, little waltz, little waltz,
of itself, of death, and of brandy
that dips its tail in the sea.
I love you, I love you, I love you,
with the armchair and the book of death,
down the melancholy hallway,
in the iris's darkened garret,
in our bed that was once the moon's bed,
and in that dance the turtle dreamed of.
Ay, ay, ay, ay!
Take this broken-waisted waltz.
In Vienna there are four mirrors
in which your mouth and the echoes play.
There is a death for piano
that paints the litde boys blue.
There are beggars on the roof.
There are fresh garlands of tears.
Ay, ay, ay, ay!
Take this waltz that dies in my arms.
Because I love you, I love you, my love,
in the attic where the children play,
dreaming ancient lights of Hungary
through the noise, the balmy afternoon,
seeing sheep and irises of snow
through the dark silence of your forehead.
Ay, ay, ay, ay!
Take this "I will always love you" waltz.
In Vienna I will dance with you
in a costume with
a river's head.
See how the hyacinths line my banks!
I will leave my mouth between your legs,
my soul in photographs and lilies,
and in the dark wake of your footsteps,
my love, my love, I will have to leave
violin and grave, the waltzing ribbons.
Neither the bull nor the fig tree know you,
nor your horses, nor the ants under your floor.
Neither the child nor the evening know you,
because you have died forever.
The spine of rock does not know you,
nor the black satin where you are ruined,
Your mute remembrance does not know you,
because you have died forever.
Autumn will come with its snails,
grapes in mist, and clustered mountains,
but no one will want to gaze in your eyes,
because you have died forever.
Because you have died forever,
like all the dead of the Earth,
like all the dead forgotten
in a pile of lifeless curs.
No one knows you. No. But I sing of you.
I sing for others your profile and grace.
The famed ripeness of your understanding.
Your appetite for death, pleasure in its savour.
The sadness your valiant gaiety contained.
Not for a long time, if ever, will there be born,
an Andalusian so brilliant, so rich in adventure.
I sing his elegance in words that moan,
and remember a sad breeze through the olive-trees.
No one understood the perfume
of the shadow magnolia of your belly.
No one knew you crushed completely
a human bird of love between your teeth.
There slept a thousand little persian horses
in the moonlight plaza of your forehead,
while, for four nights, I embraced there
your waist, the enemy of snowfall.
Between the plaster and the jasmines,
your gaze was a pale branch, seeding.
I tried to give you, in my breastbone,
the ivory letters that say ever.
Ever, ever: garden of my torture,
your body, flies from me forever,
the blood of your veins is in my mouth now,
already light-free for my death.
Often I lost myself in the sea,
my ears filled with fresh-cut flowers
my tongue filled with love and anguish.
often I lost myself in the sea,
as I am lost in the hearts of children.
No one when giving a kiss
fails to feel the smile of faceless people.
No one who touches a newborn child,
forgets the immobile skulls of horses.
Because the roses search the forehead,
for the toughened landscapes of bone,
and Mans hands have no fate,
but to imitate roots, under the ground.
As I am lost in the hearts of children,
often I lost myself in the sea.
Ignorant of water, I go searching,
for death, in light, consuming me.
It rains on Santiago
my sweet love.
White camellia of air,
sunlight in a veil.
It rains on Santiago,
in the dark night.
Grass of silver and dream
covers the empty moon.
See the rain in the streets,
the lament of stone and glass.
See on the fading wind
your seas shadow and ash.
Your seas shadow and ash,
Santiago, far from the sun:
shivering in my heart,
water of ancient dawn.
Flamenco Vignettes
Lamps of crystal
and green mirrors.
On the dark stage
Parrala holds
a dialogue
with death.
Calls her,
she wont come,
Calls her again.
The people
swallow their sobbing.
And in the green mirrors
long trails of silk
move.
The rose was
not looking for the morning:
on its branch, almost immortal,
it looked for something other.
The rose was
not looking for wisdom, or for shadow:
the edge of flesh and dreaming,
it looked for something other.
The rose was
not looking for the rose, was
unmoving in the heavens:
it looked for something other.
The stone is a brow where dreams groan,
holding no winding water or frozen cypress.
The stone is a shoulder to bear time
with trees of tears, ribbons, planets.
I have watched grey rains running to the waves
lifting their fragile, riddled arms,
so as not to be caught by the outstretched stone
that unties their limbs without drinking their blood.
Because stone collects seeds and banks of cloud,
skeletons of larks and twilight wolves,
but gives up no sounds, crystals, fire, only bullrings
and bullrings, and more bullrings with no walls.
Now Ignacio the well-born lies on the stone.
Now its done. What passes? Contemplate his form!
Death has covered him with pale sulphur
given him the head of a dark minotaur.
Now its done! Rain penetrates his mouth.
Air rises mad from his sunken chest,
and love, soaked with tears of snow,
warms himself on the heights among herds.
What are they saying? A stinking silence settles.
We are with a laid-out corpse that vanishes,
with a clear form that held nightingales
and we see it riddled with countless holes.
Who disturbs the shroud? Its not true what he says!
No ones singing here, or weeps in a corner,
or pricks his spurs, or frightens off snakes:
here I want nothing but open eyes
to see that body that cant rest.
I want to see the men with harsh voices here.
Those who tame horses and subdue rivers:
the men who rattle their bones and sing
with a mouth full of sun and flints.
I want to see them here. In front of the stone.
In front of this body with broken sinews.
I want them to show me where theres an exit
for this captain bound by death.
I want them to show me grief like a river
that has sweet mists and steep banks
to bear Ignacios body, and let him be lost
without hearing the double snort of the bulls.
Let him be lost in the moons round bullring
that imitates, new, a bull stilled by pain.
let him be lost in the night with no singing of fish
and in the white weeds of congealed smoke.
I dont want them to cover his face with a cloth,
so he can grow accustomed to death that he bears.
Go, Ignacio: dont feel the hot bellowing.
Sleep, soar, rest: even the ocean dies!
The golden girl
bathed in the water,
and the water turned to gold.
The weeds and branches
in shadow surprised her,
and the nightingale sang
for the white girl.
And the bright night came,
clouded dark silver,
with barren mountains
in the umber breeze.
The wet girl
was white in the water
and the water, blushed.
The dawn came without stain,
with its thousand bovine faces,
stiff and shrouded there
with frosty garlands.
The girl of tears
bathed among tears,
and the nightingale wept
with burning wings.
The golden girl
was a white heron
and the water turned her gold.
The Moon is dying, dying:
but will be born again in the spring.
When on the brow of the poplars
is curled the wind from the south.
When our hearts have given
their harvest of sighing.
When the rooftops are wearing
their little sombreros of weeds.
The moon is dying, dying:
but will be reborn in the spring.
For Isabelita, my sister
The evening is chanting
a berceuse to the oranges.
My little sister’s chanting:
the Earth is an orange.
The moon weeping cries:
I want to be an orange.
You cannot be, my child,
even if you were reddened.
Not even if you turned lemon.
What a shame that is!
When the moon sails out
the bells fade into stillness
and there emerge the pathways
that cant be penetrated.
When the moon sails out
the water hides earths surface,
the heart feels like an island
in the infinite silence.
Nobody eats an orange
under the moons fullness.
It is correct to eat, then,
green and icy fruit.
When the moon sails out
with a hundred identical faces,
the coins made of silver
sob in your pocket.
Under the orange-tree
she washes baby-clothes.
Her eyes of green
and voice of violet.
Ay, love,
under the orange-tree in bloom!
The water in the ditch
flowed, filled with light,
a sparrow chirped
in the little olive-tree.
Ay, love,
under the orange-tree in bloom!
Later, when Lola
has exhausted the soap,
young bullfighters will come.
Ay, love,
under the orange-tree in bloom!
It begins, the lament
of the guitar.
The wineglass of dawn
is broken.
It begins, the lament
of the guitar.
Its useless to silence it.
Impossible
to silence it.
It cries monotonously
as the water cries,
as the wind cries
over the snow.
Impossible
to silence it.
It cries for
distant things.
Sands of the hot South
that demand white camellias.
It cries arrows with no targets,
evening with no morning,
and the first dead bird
on the branch.
Oh, the guitar!
Heart wounded deep
by five swords.
At five in the afternoon.
It was just five in the afternoon.
A boy brought the white sheet
at five in the afternoon.
A basket of lime made ready
at five in the afternoon.
The rest was death and only death
at five in the afternoon.
The wind blew the cotton wool away
at five in the afternoon.
And oxide scattered nickel and glass
at five in the afternoon.
Now the dove and the leopard fight
at five in the afternoon.
And a thigh with a desolate horn
at five in the afternoon.
The bass-pipe sound began
at five in the afternoon.
The bells of arsenic, the smoke
at five in the afternoon.
Silent crowds on corners
at five in the afternoon.
And only the bull with risen heart!
at five in the afternoon.
When the snow-sweat appeared
at five in the afternoon.
when the arena was splashed with iodine
at five in the afternoon.
death laid its eggs in the wound
at five in the afternoon.
At five in the afternoon.
At just five in the afternoon.
A coffin on wheels for his bed
at five in the afternoon.
Bones and flutes sound in his ear
at five in the afternoon.
Now the bull bellows on his brow
at five in the afternoon.
The room glows with agony
at five in the afternoon.
Now out of distance gangrene comes
at five in the afternoon.
Trumpets of lilies for the green groin
at five in the afternoon.
Wounds burning like suns
at five in the afternoon,
and the people smashing windows
at five in the afternoon.
At five in the afternoon.
Ay, what a fearful five in the afternoon!
It was five on every clock!
It was five of a dark afternoon!
New Yorks dawn holds
four mud pillars,
and a hurricane of black doves,
paddling in foul water.
New Yorks dawn
moans on vast stairways,
searching on the ledges,
for anguished tuberoses.
Dawn breaks and no ones mouth breathes it,
since hope and tomorrow, here, have no meaning.
Sometimes coins, furiously swarming,
stab and devour the abandoned children.
The first to go outside know in their bones
Paradise will not be there, nor wild loves.
They know they go to the swamp of law, and numbers,
to play without art, and labour without fruit.
The light is buried by chains and by noise,
in the shameless challenge, of rootless science.
All across the suburbs, sleepless crowds stumble,
as if saved, by the moment, from a shipwreck of blood.
Ive closed my balcony
for I dont want to hear the weeping,
yet out beyond the grey walls
nothing is heard but weeping.
There are very few angels singing,
there are very few dogs barking,
a thousand violins fit in the palm of my hand.
But the weepings a dog, immense,
the weepings an angel, immense,
the weepings a violin, immense
the tears have silenced the wind,
and nothing is heard but weeping.
Theres a bitter root
and a world of a thousand terraces.
Not even the smallest hand
shatters the gate of waters.
Where are you going, where, where?
Theres a sky of a thousand windows
—a battle of bruised bees—
and theres a bitter root.
Bitter.
Sore on the sole of the foot,
on the inside of the face,
and sore in the cool trunk
of the freshly cut night.
Love, my enemy,
bite on your bitter root!
Look at that white gallant
look at his wasted flesh!
Its the moon thats dancing
in the Courtyard of the Dead.
Look at his wasted flesh,
black with twilight and wolves.
Mother: The moon dances
in the Courtyard of the Dead.
Who wounds the horse of stone
at the gates of sleep?
Its the moon! Its the moon
in the Courtyard of the Dead!
Who looks in my grey windows,
with an eye full of cloud?
Its the moon! Its the moon
in the Courtyard of the Dead!
Let me die in my bed
dreaming the flower of gold.
Mother: The moon dances
in the Courtyard of the Dead.
Ay, daughter, the air in the sky
has suddenly turned me white!
It isnt the air, its the sad moon
in the Courtyard of the Dead.
Who groans with that groan
of an ox, huge and malcontent?
Mother: Its the moon, the moon
in the Courtyard of the Dead.
Yes, the moon, the moon,
crowned with yellow gorse,
that dances, dances, dances,
in the Courtyard of the Dead!
   Its True
Ay, the pain it costs me
to love you as I love you!
For love of you, the air, it hurts,
and my heart,
and my hat, they hurt me.
Who would buy it from me,
this ribbon I am holding,
and this sadness of cotton,
white, for making handkerchiefs with?
Ay, the pain it costs me
to love you as I love you!
Through black butterflies
goes a girl with dark hair
joined to a white serpent
of mistiness.
Earth of light,
Sky of Earth.
She goes tied to the trembling
of a rhythm that never arrives:
she has a heart of silver
and a dagger in her hand.
Where do you go, Siguiriya
with a mindless rhythm?
What moon will gather up your
grief of lime and oleander?
Earth of light,
Sky of Earth.
The Guadalquivir’s river
runs past oranges and olives.
The two rivers of Granada,
fall, to wheatfields, out of snow.
Ay, Love, that goes,
and never returns!
The Guadalquivir’s river
has a beard of clear garnet.
The two rivers of Granada
one of sorrow, one of blood.
Ay, Love,
vanished down the wind!
For the sailing-boats,
Seville keeps a roadway:
Through the waters of Granada
only sighs can row.
Ay, Love, that went,
and never returned!
Guadalquivir — high tower,
and breeze in the orange-trees.
Dauro, Genil — dead turrets,
dead, above the ponds.
Ay, Love,
vanished down the wind!
Who can say, if water carries
a ghost-fire of cries?
Ay, Love, 
that went,and never returned!
Take the orange petals,take the leaves of olives,
Andalusia, down to your sea.
Ay, Love,
vanished on the wind!
Visceral love, living death,
in vain, I wait your written word,
and consider, with the flower that withers,
I wish to lose you, if I have to live without self.
The air is undying: the inert rock
neither knows shadow, nor evades it.
And the heart, inside, has no use
for the honeyed frost the moon pours.
But I endured you: ripped open my veins,
a tiger, a dove, over your waist,
in a duel of teeth and lilies.
So fill my madness with speech,
or let me live in my calm
night of the soul, darkened for ever.
Córdoba.
Far away, and lonely.
Full moon, black pony,
olives against my saddle.
Though I know all the roadways
Ill never get to Córdoba.
Through the breezes, through the valley,
red moon, black pony.
Death is looking at me
from the towers of Córdoba.
Ay, how long the road is!
Ay, my brave pony!
Ay, death is waiting for me,
before I get to Córdoba.
Córdoba.
Far away, and lonely.
Ah me, my dark love's ever secret call!
Ah me, that bleating without wool! That gash!
Ah me, that needle of gall, camellia like ash!
Ah me, this sealess tide, city with no wall!
This endless night with silhouette secure,
celestial mountain formed of anguish and distress!
Alas, this dog in my heart, my voice so stressed!
Ah me, the silence is boundless, the lily mature.
You heated voice of ice, go, let me be,
don't try to make me lose my way in the slough
with flesh and heaven moaning fruitlessly. 
Leave the hard ivory shell of my brow,
take away my pain! oh pity me,
for I am love, and I am nature now!
Arbolé, arbolé
seco y verdé.
The girl with the lovely face,
goes, gathering olives.
The wind, that towering lover,
takes her by the waist.
Four riders go by
on Andalusian ponies,
in azure and emerald suits,
in long cloaks of shadow.
‘Come to Cordoba, sweetheart!’
The girl does not listen.
Three young bullfighters go by,
slim-waisted
in suits of orange,
with swords of antique silver.
‘Come to Sevilla, sweetheart!’
The girl does not listen.
When the twilight purples,
with the daylight’s dying,
a young man goes by, holding
roses, and myrtle of moonlight.
‘Come to Granada, my sweetheart!’
But the girl does not listen.
The girl, with the lovely face,
goes on gathering olives,
while the wind’s grey arms
go circling her waist.
Arbolé arbolé
seco y verdé.
With a slit tongue
and open eyes
the nightingale on the ramparts
Eyes of stored-up pain
and feathers of blood
the nightingale on the ramparts
Feathers of blood and brief dazzle
fresh water given birth in the throat
the nightingale on the ramparts
Water that runs stricken with love
water with wings
the nightingale on the ramparts
Among black stones the white voice
of love-struck water
the nightingale on the ramparts
Singing with slit tongue
blood on the stone
the nightingale on the ramparts
Thin and sinuous
as the magic rope.
Blonde and impetuous:
dart and kite.
But also relentless, an icebreaking ship.
A girl's breasts, enameled eyes.
She'd danced on all the terraces and in all the boîtes,
had watched the sun set over San José, Costa Rica,
had slept at the feet of the Himalayas,
and in Africa had grown weary of savannahs and bars.
At twenty she left her husband
for a German woman;
at twenty-one she left the German
for an Afghan man;
at forty-five
she lives at Prosperine Court, int. 2, Bombay.
Each month, on the ritual days,
it rains frogs and snakes on her house,
the servants curse the she-demon,
and her Parsi lover puts out the fire.
Dry storm.
The white vulture
pecks at its shadow.

Hammers pound there above
pulverized voices
From the top of the afternoon
the builders come straight down
We're between blue and good evening
here begin vacant lots
A pale puddle suddenly blazes
the shade of the hummingbird ignites it
Reaching the first houses
the summer oxidizes
Someone has closed the door......someone
speaks with his shadow
It darkens......There's no one in the street now
not even this dog
scared to walk through it alone
One's afraid to close one's eyes
What sustains it,
Half-open, the clarity of nightfall,
The light let loose in the gardens?
All the branches,
Conquered by the weight of birds,
Lean toward the darkness.
Pure, self-absorbed moments
Still gleam
On the fences.
Receiving night,
The groves become
Hushed fountains.
A bird falls,
The grass grows dark,
Edges blur, lime is black,
The world is less credible.

Two bodies face to face
Are sometimes like two waves
And the night is an ocean.
Two bodies face to face
Are sometimes like two stones
And the night is a desert.
Two bodies face to face
Are sometimes like the roots
Joined in the night.
Two bodies face to face
Are sometimes like knives
And the night is a lightening.
Two bodies face to face
Are like two stars that fall
In an empty sky.
Between going and staying the day wavers,
in love with its own transparency.
The circular afternoon is now a bay
where the world in stillness rocks.
All is visible and all elusive,
all is near and can't be touched.
Paper, book, pencil, glass,
rest in the shade of their names.
Time throbbing in my temples repeats
the same unchanging syllable of blood.
The light turns the indifferent wall
into a ghostly theater of reflections.
I find myself in the middle of an eye,
watching myself in its blank stare.
The moment scatters. Motionless,
I stay and go: I am a pause.

Homage to Claudius Ptolemy
I am a man: little do I last
and the night is enormous.
But I look up:
the stars write.
Unknowing I understand:
I too am written,
and at this very moment
someone spells me out.
I know a giant, strange hymn 
that proclaims a dawn in the night of the soul
and these pages are cadences of that hymn,
cadences that the air spreads in the shadows.
I would like to write it, taming
man's rebellious and poor language
with words that would be at once
sighs and laughter, colors and tones.
But the struggle is in vain; there is no cipher
capable of containing it; and hardly, oh my beauty!
could I, holding your hands in mine,
softly sing it to you when we were alone.
Arrow flying thru the heavens
shot off and crossing by chance,
no one ever ventures guesses
where it will tremblingly fall;
withered leaf of autumn forest
battered by southerly blast,
no one knowing in which hollow
it will happen soon to fall;
giant wave the wind and weather
twists and tosses out at sea,
rolling, passing, never knowing
on what beach it comes to fall;
light of wisps or vibrant haloes
shining, but only to fade,
not knowing which of their number
will shine on the last of all:
such am I, perhaps by hazard
crossing the earth come what may,
never knowing whence nor whither
my steps carry me today.
Never say your lexicon is exhausted,
that for lack of content, the lyre is silent.
There may be no poets, but there will
always be poetry!
As long as rolling waves are caressed
by the kiss of light;
as long as the sun clothes the clouds
with fire and gold;
as long as the air can bring us
perfumes and harmonies;
as long as there is spring time,
there will be poetry! 
As long as science fails to discover
the origin of life,
and the sea or the sky holds an abyss
that defies explanation;
as long as Humanity continues advancing
toward an unknown goal;
as long as mankind has unsolved mysteries,
there will be poetry!
As long as the soul can be happy
without a smile on its lips;
as long as one is able to cry without
tears in ones eyes;
as long as heart and mind
keep on battling;
as long as there are hopes and memories,
there will be poetry!
As long as there are eyes that mirror
the eyes that look at them;
as long as sighing lips can respond
to lips that sigh;
as long as two souls can feel they are
joined in a kiss;
as long as there is a beautiful woman,
there will be poetry!
A nameless feeling,
an indefinable essence,
I live within the formless
life of the idea.
I swim in the void,
I tremble in the suns fire,
I shiver in the shadows
and I float in the mists.
I am the golden spark
of the distant star;
I am the pale and serene
light of the full moon.
I am the burning cloud
that floats in the sunset;
I am the luminous track
of the wandering star. 
I am snow on the peaks,
I am fire in the sands,
a blue wave in the seas
and foam on the shores.
In the lute I am music,
aroma in the violet,
a fleeting light in the tombs
and ivy on the ruins.
I sing with the lark
and buzz with the bee,
I mimic the sounds
that are heard in the night.
I rumble in the torrent
and hiss in the spark,
and I flash in the lightning
and roar in the storm.
I laugh on the hillsides,
I whisper in the tall grass,
I sigh in the clear water
and cry on the dry leaf.
I ripple with the plumes
of smoke that slowly rise
and climb to the heavens
in an immense spiral.
In the golden threads
that spiders hang from trees,
I rock back and forth
in a fervent dream.
I run after the nymphs
that frolic naked
in the swift current
of the sparkling stream.
In the forests of coral
that shade the white pearls
in the Ocean, I pursue
the agile water nymphs.
In the hollow caverns
where the sun does not reach,
I mingle with the gnomes
and gaze on their riches.
I search for the traces
of forgotten centuries,
and I remember those empires
whose name is erased. 
I follow the dizzy course
of the rotating worlds,
and my eye encompasses
the entire universe.
I perceive those regions
where no sound reaches,
and where unborn stars
await the breath of life.
I am the bridge
that spans the abyss;
I am the unknown ladder
connecting heaven and earth.
In short, I am that spirit,
the unknown essence,
the mysterious fragrance
whose receptacle is the poet.
Like a breeze that cools the blood
on the dark field of battle,
she wanders through the silent night
full of perfumes and harmonies;
a symbol of pain and tenderness,
in the tragic drama of the English bard,
sweet Ophelia, having lost her mind,
passes by picking flowers and singing.
There in the dusky alcove of the room,
Perchance forgotten by its owner now,
Silent beneath its covering of dust,
The harp was seen.
How many a song was slumbering in its strings,
As in some bird-breast sleeping on the boughs,
Waiting the snowy hand whose master touch
Shall waken it!
Alas, methought -- how often genius halts
And drowses thus within the bosom's depth,
Hoping to hear a voice, like Lazarus,
To say its message, -- "Soul, arise and walk!"
When I see the blue horizon
vanish in the distance
behind a shimmering cloud
filled with gold,
it seems like I could rise from
this wretched earth
and float in the golden clouds,
dissolved into tiny
particles like they are.
When I gaze into the depths
of the sky at night
and see the stars tremble like shining
eyes of fire,
it seems like I could climb
to where they shine
and bathe in their light, and merge
with them in a kiss
of incandescent light.
In the sea of doubt through which I sail,
I hardly know what I believe;
nevertheless, these desires tell me
that I carry something
divine here inside me!
The dawn moans softly and kisses
the gentle waves as they float by;
the sun kisses the cloud in the East,
and tints it with purple and gold;
the flame slips around the burning
trunk so it can kiss another flame,
and even the willow bends down
to kiss the river that has kissed it.
"I am a passion; I am a flame;
I am a symbol of loves that go,
I am that desire which transcends shame
Is it I you seek?"
"Not you: no!"
"My brow is pale, my hair is gold;
I can make your dreams come true.
Treasures of tenderness I hold-
Is it I you call?"
"No: not you!"
"I am a mystery; I am a dream;
A fleeting phantom of light and gloom;
A mist; a shadow; not what I seem,
I cannot love you!"
"Oh, come, come!"
[Imitación de Byron]
Your eyes are blue, and when you laugh,
their soft splendor makes me think of
the brilliant morning sunlight
that is reflected on the sea.
Your eyes are blue, and when you cry,
the transparent teardrops in them
make me think of drops of dew
on a violet.
Your eyes are blue, and if in their depths
an idea glows like a point of light,
it makes me think of an evening star
swallowed by the sky.
You floated for a moment before my face,
and then the image of your eyes remained,
like a dark spot ringed by fire,
if one is blinded gazing at the sun.
Wherever I happen to fix my sight
I see your flaming eyes again;
but it is not you; it is only your gaze,
just your eyes, and nothing more.
I see them glowing in the corner
of my bedroom, disembodied and unreal;
when asleep I have the feeling they
are wide open, gazing upon me.
I know there are will-o-the-wisps at night
that lead the traveler astray;
I feel myself drawn by your eyes;
but where they draw me, I do not know.

[Tú y yo.
Melodía.]
A floating cloud of light mist,
a curling wave of white foam,
an insistent murmur,
a golden harp,
a kiss of dawn, a beam of light,
that is what you are.
You, an ethereal shadow that vanishes
when I try to touch you,
like a flame, like a sound,
like a cloud, like a ripple
on the blue lake.
A noisy wave on the boundless sea;
in the void, an errant comet;
the haunting lament
of the roaring wind,
a constant longing for something better,
that is what I am.
I, who in my torment, rest my eyes
on your eyes both night and day;
I, who tirelessly and madly chase
after a shadow, the passionate creature
of a vision!
[Serenata]
If the bluebells sway back and forth
on your balcony
and you think a gentle wind is sighing
as it passes by,
know that, hidden among the green leaves,
it is I who sigh.
If a mysterious sound is heard somewhere
behind your back,
and you think a distant voice has called you
by your name,
know that, amid the shadows that surround you,
it is I who call you.
If in the middle of the night your heart
is filled with fear
when you feel a hot breath blowing
on your lips,
know that, by your side, though invisible,
it is I who breathe
Today both earth and heaven smile on me;
today the sunlight reaches the depths of my soul;
today I saw her, I saw her, and she looked at me
Today I believe in God!
Tired of dancing,
red in the face and short of breath,
resting on my arm
she paused at one end of the hall.
Above the delicate
fabric over her heaving breast
a flower was swaying
steadily and sweetly back and forth.
As though in an ivory cradle
rocked by the sea and caressed by the wind,
perhaps it was sleeping
while soothed by the breath from her lips.
Oh—I thought—if only
I might allow time to slip by like that!
Oh, if flowers sleep,
what a beautiful dream!
When you bow your wistful
face over your breast,
you make me think of
a fallen lily.
Because by granting you the purity
which is a heavenly symbol,
God created you, like the lily,
with white and gold.
If your red lips are ever heated
by an invisible burst of air, you will know
that a soul that speaks through its eyes
can also kiss with a glance.
What is poetry? you ask as you fix
your blue eyes on my eyes.
What is poetry? And you are asking me?
Poetry is you.
How can that rose survive, which you have
pinned next to your heart?
Until now, I have never looked upon
a flower over a volcano.
[A ella. No sé...]
For a glance, the world;
for a smile, the heavens;
for a kiss, I dont know what
I would give for a kiss!
[Dos y uno]
Two red tongues of fire
move closer when they wrap
around a trunk, and as they kiss
they form a single flame;
Two notes are plucked
from a lute at the same time,
and when they meet in space
they form a harmonious chord;
two waves come together
to expire on a shore,
and in breaking they are crowned
with a crest of silver;
two long bands of mist
rise up from the lake,
and as they meet in the sky
they form a white cloud;
two simultaneous ideas,
two kisses that sound in unison,
two echoes that merge,
those are our two souls.
At night when you are cradled
by the silken wings of sleep,
and your curved eyelashes
appear like ebony arches,
to be able to hear the beats
of your restless heart
and then to lean your sleeping
head on my breast,
my dear, I would give,
all that I possess:
light, air
and thought!
When your eyes are fixed
on an invisible object,
and your lips are lighted
by the hint of a smile, 
to be able to read on your
face the silent thoughts
that pass like a cloud
above the mirror of the sea,
my dear, I would give
all that I desire:
fame, gold,
glory and talent!
When your voice is silent,
and your breath quickens,
when your cheeks light up,
and your black eyes are half-closed,
to be able to see the burning spark
of moist fire that shines through
your eyelashes, as it erupts
from the volcano of desires,
my dear, I would give,
for all that I hope:
faith, spirit,
earth and heaven!
Against my interests I must confess,
my beloved, that like you
I believe that an ode is only good
written on the back of a banknote.
When they hear this, some fools
will be shocked and say:
Oh, how materialistic and prosaic, typical
of the nineteenth century Nonsense!
Words spouted by a few poets who cloak
themselves with their lyre during the winter!
The barking of dogs who howl at the moon!
You and I both know that in this life,
there are few who have the talent to write it,
and with gold, anyone can make poetry.
[Duerme]
I am afraid to see you awake;
asleep, I dare to look at you;
therefore, soul of my soul,
I watch you as you sleep.
You laugh while you are awake
and your restless lips resemble
red lightning flashes that snake
across a snowy sky.
Asleep, the corners of your mouth 
curve with a smile
that is soft like the luminous path
of a sun that is dying
So sleep!
Awake, you watch, and as you watch
your moist eyes shine
like a blue wave whose crest reflects
the sparkling sunlight.
As you sleep, a tranquil glow seeps
through your eyelids
like a transparent lampshade that emits
its soothing light
So sleep!
Awake, you speak, and as you speak
your vibrant words resemble
a rain of pearls that pours in torrents
into a golden cup.
Asleep, in the faint murmur of your
regular breathing
I hear a poem that my lovesick soul
can understand
So sleep!
I have placed my hand
over my heart, so that its beating
will not be heard and disturb
the solemn stillness of the night.
I have closed the blinds
of your balcony so that
the dawns intrusive light
will not awaken you
So sleep!
When a hidden voice
murmurs amid the shadows,
and disturbs their sad tranquility,
if I hear it echo sweetly
in the depths of my soul,
tell me: is it the wind that moans,
or is it your sighs that speak
to me of love as they pass by?
When the red sunlight enters
my window in the morning,
and my love invokes your shadow,
if it seems like I feel the sensation
of another mouth touching mine, 
tell me: am I raving madly,
or is it a kiss that your heart
sends me in a sigh?
If in the light of day
and in the dark of night,
and in everything around
the soul that loves you
it seems I see and feel you,
tell me: is what I touch and see
a dream, or do you give me
your breath to drink in a sigh?
A tear appeared in her eyes
and I started to say I was sorry;
her pride spoke and her tears dried up,
and the words died on my lips. 
Now I go my way, and she goes hers;
but when I think about our shared love,
I still wonder: Why was I silent that day?
and she must say: Why didnt I cry?
Our passion became a tragic farce
in whose absurd plot
the mixture of comedy and seriousness
produced laughter and tears.
But the worst part of that play was
that, by the end of the act,
she had both tears and laughter,
and I had only tears!
Enveloped in her beauty she passed by,
and I let her keep on going;
nor did I turn to look at her, and nevertheless,
something whispered to me: It is her.
Why does the evening follow the morning?
I know not; I only know
that during one brief summer night
twilights were joined and she left.
It is a question of words, and nevertheless,
after what happened,
neither you nor I were ever able to agree
whose fault it was.
It is too bad that the dictionary of love
does not explain
when pride is simply pride,
and when it is dignity!
She walks quietly and her movements are
silent harmony;
her steps are heard, and they resemble
the rhythmic cadence of a glorious hymn.
She partly opens her eyes, those eyes
as bright as day;
and all that heaven and earth encloses
burns with a new light in her eyes.
She laughs, and her laughter sounds
like running water;
She cries, and each tear is a poem
of infinite tenderness.
She has the light, the aroma
the warmth and the shape;
her figure, the birth place of desires,
her language, an eternal source of poetry.
She seems stupid? Bah! While she is silent,
she hides an obscure enigma;
what she keeps silent, in my opinion, is worth
more than what anyone else says.
Your rejection did not surprise me! In fact,
your brief affection surprised me more;
since, as for what really matters about me,
of that you never had a clue!
If only the story of our wrongs could be
written in a book,
and all that was omitted from its pages
could be erased from our souls;
The love I still feel for you, has left such
deep traces in my heart,
that if you were to remove only one,
I might remove them all!
I will die before you: still hidden
inside my heart
is the blade that, wielded by your hand,
opened the mortal wound.
I will die before you; and my spirit,
seated at the door of death
with stubborn determination, will be waiting
for your arrival. 
Hours turn to days, days turn to years
which then fly by,
and you will finally knock at that door
Does anyone not knock?
Then the earth will swallow your guilt
and your remains,
cleansing you with the waters of death,
as in another Jordan;
there where the murmur of life
finally dies,
like the wave that reaches the shore
to silently expire;
there where the tomb is sealed,
an eternity opens
and all that we have both kept silent
we will have to admit!
Sighs are air and they return to the air.
Tears are water and they return to the sea.
Tell me, woman: when love is forgotten,
do you know where it goes?
Why do you tell me? I know: she is flighty,
she is arrogant, vain and capricious;
before her soul shows compassion,
water will flow from a barren rock.
I know that in her heart, a nest of snakes,
there is nothing that responds to love;
that she is a lifeless statue; however
She is so beautiful!
You were the hurricane and I, the lofty
tower that defied its power.
You had to explode or tear me down!
It could never be!
You were the ocean and I, the upright
rock that firmly resisted its movement:
You had to break down, or wash me away!
It could never be!
You were beautiful and I, proud; the one
used to dominance, the other not to give in;
the path was narrow, the clash, inevitable
It could never be!
When they told me, I felt the chill
of a knife blade in my heart;
I leaned against the wall, and for a moment
I lost track of where I was.
Night descended on my spirit;
my soul was drowned in anger and in pity
And then I understood why one weeps,
and then I understood why one kills!
The cloud of grief passed painfully,
I managed to stammer a few words
and what could I do? he was a friend
he had done me a favor I thanked him.
I put aside the light and sat down
on the edge of my unmade bed,
silent, somber, my eyes fixed
motionlessly on the wall.
How long did it last? I dont know: at last,
when the horrible drunkenness of pain left me,
the light had gone out, and on my balcony
the sun was shining.
Nor, during that terrible time, do I know
what I was thinking, or what was happening;
all I remember is that I cried and I cursed,
and that on that night, I grew older.
I can read what is in your eyes
as though in an open book;
so why do your lips feign laughter
that is denied by your eyes?
Go ahead and cry! Dont be ashamed
to confess that you loved me a little.
Go on, cry; no one is looking!
See, Im a man and I am crying too!
On the unsteady keystone of the arch
whose stones were reddened by time,
was a gothic coat of arms carved
by a crude hand. 
Ivy was hanging over the crest
of the granite helmet and cast shadows
over the coat of arms, on which a hand
was holding a heart.
In the deserted plaza the two of us
stopped to look at it;
That, she told me, is the perfect symbol
of my constant love.
Alas! What she told me then is true:
true, that she would hold
my heart in her hand or someplace else
but never in her breast.
Hiding in the shadows she wounded me,
sealing her betrayal with a kiss.
She threw her arms around my neck, and in cold
blood, stabbed me behind my back.
And now she continues happily on her way,
pleased, smiling, undaunted; and why is that?
Because the wound could not be seen
Because the corpse was walking!
I have delved into the deep chasms
of earth and heaven;
I have probed their depths, with my eyes
or with my mind.
But alas!, when I reached the abyss of a heart
and I leaned down to examine it,
my soul and my eyes became disturbed:
it was so deep and so black!
Like one pulls the blade from a wound,
I tore my love for her out of my heart
although as I did it, I felt that my life
was torn out with it.
I removed her image from the pedestal
which my love had erected in my soul,
and the light of faith that had burned on it
was extinguished before the empty altar. 
But her stubborn vision still entered my mind
to struggle against my firm determination
When will I be able to sleep, with this dream
which keeps me awake!
Sometimes I encounter her in public
and she passes by me;
she walks by me smiling, and I say:
How can she smile?
Then another smile appears on my lips,
a mask to hide my pain,
and so I think: Perhaps her smile
is the same as mine!
Like a savage who hastily carves a god
from a block of wood with his awkward hand,
and then he kneels before his work,
that was what you and I did.
We gave actual shape to a phantom,
a ridiculous invention of the mind;
and once the idol was created, we sacrificed
our love on its altar.
I would gladly give the best years
from the short time I have left to live
to know what you have said
of me to others.
And this mortal life and whatever
afterlife I may have, if I have one,
to know what you have thought
of me when you were alone.
Giant waves that break with a roar
on distant deserted shores,
wrap me in a sheet of foam
and carry me away!
Hurricane gusts that blow away
dry leaves from the lofty wood,
drag me in a whirlwind across the sky
and carry me away!
Storm clouds that the lightning breaks,
you tip with fire your tattered edges,
drag me through the darkening mists
and carry me away!
Have pity, take me where vertigo
will take my memory and my reason...
Have pity! I am frightened to be alone
with my grief, alone, alone!
As we remember the past and recall
those fleeting hours,
a teardrop shines on her black eyelashes
and it trembles, about to slide down.
Then, it finally slides and falls like a drop
of dew, as we realize
that we both feel a longing, today for yesterday,
and tomorrow for today.
Amid the loud uproar of the revelry
the echo of a sigh
caressed my ears, like a distant
note of music.
I recognized the echo of that sigh,
formed by the same air I have breathed,
the scent of a hidden flower that grows
in a dark cloister.
My beloved of the moment asked me
affectionately, What are you thinking?
Oh, nothing But why do you cry? My sadness
is happy; it is the wine that is sad.
Today like yesterday, tomorrow like today,
and always the same!
A dreary gray sky, an endless horizon,
and it goes on and on!
My heart is beating mechanically, like
a stupid machine;
my sluggish intellect sleeps in the corner
of my brain.
My soul longs for a paradise
and searches without hope;
a pointless effort, a wave that rolls on,
without knowing why. 
An incessant voice that sings the same song
with the same tone;
a drop of water that drips monotonously
and never stops falling.
This is how the days keep sliding by,
one after the other,
today the same as yesterday and all of them
without joy or sorrow.
Alas!, sometimes I feel a longing
my former suffering
Sorrow can be painful; but at least
to suffer is to live!
This framework of flesh and bones
has finally tired of carrying around
this crazy head, and I am not surprised;
although it is true that I am not old,
when I think of how I have lived
this life, it pains me to say
that the way I have lived it feels like
I have squeezed a century into each day.
So, if I were to die right now,
I could never say I have not lived;
though the garment looks new outside,
I know that, on the inside, it has aged.
Yes, it has aged, despite my lucky star!,
my painful determination shows that clearly;
because there is pain that leaves its scar
on the heart, but not on the forehead.
Do you want to taste this delicious nectar
without the dregs?
Well, bring it to your lips, breathe it in,
and then set it aside.
Do you want us to preserve the pleasant
memory of this love?
Well let us love each other today, and tomorrow
let us say goodbye!
I know why it is
you sigh;
I know the cause of your sweet
hidden languor.
Are you laughing? Some day,
girl, you will know why;
perhaps you suspect it,
and I know it.
I know what you dream
and what you see in dreams.
On your face I can read like a book
what you do not say.
Are you laughing? Some day,
girl, you will know why;
perhaps you suspect it,
and I know it.
I know why you smile and cry
at the same time;
I can pierce the mysterious depths
of your womanly soul.
Are you laughing? Some day,
girl, you will know why;
while you feel a lot and know nothing
I, who no longer feel, know it all.
My life is a wasteland:
every flower I touch loses its petals;
as I follow my fated path
someone keeps on planting evil
so that I will pick it.
[Melodía.Es muy triste morir joven, y no contarcon una sola lágrima de mujer]
When my hours of sickness
and insomnia are evident,
on the side of my bed,
who will sit down?
When I am about to expire
and I stretch out a trembling hand,
searching for another hand,
who will clasp it?
When death turns the surface
of my eyes glassy,
and my eyes are still open,
who will close them? 
While the bell tolls
(if it tolls at my funeral),
when they hear it,
who will say a prayer?
When my pallid remains
are covered by the earth,
above the forgotten grave,
who will come to weep?
Who, then, on another day
when the sun shines again,
that I lived in this the world,
who will remember?
[Al amanecer]
First comes a dim hint of whiteness,
a trembling ray of light that crosses the sea;
then it sparkles and grows and spreads
in a burning explosion of clarity.
That brilliant light is happiness;
but this timid shadow is my grief;
Alas!; in the dark night of my soul,
when will it dawn?
Like a swarm of angry bees,
in the dark corner of my memory
my recollections of the past
begin to pursue me.
I try in vain to drive them away!
They pursue me relentlessly,
and one after another they sting me
with a sharp prick that infects my soul.
Like a miser guards his treasure,
I protected my pain;
I tried to prove there is something eternal
to the one who promised me her eternal love.
But now I plead with her in vain, and I hear
her say it has ended:
Ah, you sad piece of clay, not even
your suffering is eternal!
Night came and I could not find refuge;
and I was thirsty! I drank my tears.
And I was hungry! I closed
my swollen eyes to die!
Was I in a dessert? Though in my ears
I could hear the loud voice of the crowds,
I was orphaned and poor The world was
empty for me!
Where do I come from? Seek the steepest
path you can find.
The trail of bloody footprints
on the bare rock,
the remains of a soul torn apart
by the sharp thorns,
will show you the path
that leads to my cradle.
Where am I going? Cross the darkest
and the saddest wasteland,
a valley of eternal snows and constant
melancholy mists.
Where you find a solitary stone
with no inscription,
where forgetfulness reigns,
there will be my tomb.
How beautiful it is to see the dawn
when it is crowned with fire,
and its kiss of flames
ignites the waves and inflames the air!
How beautiful it is, after the rain
on a sad, gray afternoon in autumn,
to fill you lungs
with the aroma of the moist flowers!
How beautiful it is, when the white
flakes of snow are quietly falling,
to see the red tongues
of of the flickering fire move back and forth.
How beautiful it is, when you are sleepy,
to sleep well and snore like a pig
to eat, and get fat! And what a shame it is
that only that is not enough!
I do not know what
I dreamed last night;
the dream must have been unhappy,
because I still felt sad when I awoke.
As I sat up I noticed
my damp pillow,
and when I saw it for the first time
my soul felt a bitter-sweet pleasure.
It is too bad when
a dream makes us weep;
but this sadness makes me happy.
I know that I still have some tears!
¡La vida es sueño!Calderón.
With a flash of lightning we are born,
and its light is still glowing when we die:
our life is that short!
The glory and the love we chase after
are shadows of a dream that we pursue.
Death is an awakening!
How many times, next to the moss-covered
walls that hide it,
as night came to a close I heard the bell
that calls to matins!
How many times the silver moon cast
my mournful shadow,
next to that of the cypress tree that rose
over the stone walls.
When the pointed arch of the church
was wrapped in shadows,
how many times I saw the light of a lamp
flickering behind the windows!
Even though the wind whistled through
the openings in the tower,
amid voices of the chorus I could hear
her voice quite clearly.
On winter nights, if some timid soul
happened to pass through
the deserted plaza, when he saw me,
he quickened his pace.
In the morning, there once was
an old woman who said
I must be the soul of some dead sacristan
who passed away in sin.
In the darkness I could see the corners
of the atrium and the portal;
the nettles growing there were perhaps
to hide my footprints.
The owls were fearful, following me
with their blazing eyes,
but in time, they came to look on me
as an old friend.
The reptiles crawled along by my side
without being afraid.
I saw that even the silent saints of granite
were welcoming me!
Sleepless I wandered in that limbo
where all objects lose their shapes,
mysterious spaces that separate
waking life from sleep.
Thoughts that silently revolved
in wheeling dance about my brain
little by little reduced their pace
to a slower time.
The reflection of the light that comes to the soul
in through the eyes was veiled by the lids;
but the world of vision was lit from within
by another light.
At this point there echoed in my ears
a wavering sound, confused like that
in a church when the faithful are ending their prayers
with a firm 'Amen'.
And I seemed to hear a delicate, sad
voice that called me by name from afar
and I smelt the smell of snuffed-out candles,
of damp and fragrant incense
Night came down, and in the arms
of oblivion I fell like a stone
into her deep breast, and waking cried:
"Someone I loved has died!"
Their cloaks loosened,
their backs uncovered,
on the lintel of the doorway
two angels were watching.
I approached the iron bars
that guarded the entrance,
and far behind the double iron grates
I saw her white figure.
I saw her like an image
that appears in a dream,
like a dim and scattered ray of light
that swims in the shadows.
I began to feel a burning
desire that filled my soul;
like an abyss that beckons, that mystery
was drawing me closer!
But alas!, the angels with their
steadfast gaze seemed to be saying:
No one but God can cross
the threshold of this door!
Can it be true that, when sleep touches
our eyes with its rosy fingers,
our spirit escapes from its prison
in a hurried flight?
Can it be true that, on gentle breaths
of nocturnal breezes, it rises into
empty space, a guest of the mists,
to meet with others?
And there, denuded of its human form,
there, with its earthly bonds broken,
it lives for a short time in the solitary
world of the idea?
And laughs and cries, and hates and loves
and leaves behind a trace of pain and joy,
similar to the trail left by a meteor
when it crosses the sky?
I am not sure if this world of visions
exists outside, or if it lives within us;
but I know that I know many people
whom I have never known!
You say you have a heart, however
you only say that since you feel it beating.
That is not a heart; it is a machine
that makes noise as it moves.
Pretending realities
that are superficial,
Hope marches
in front of Desire;
and all its lies
are reborn, like the Phoenix,
out of its ashes.
One woman has poisoned my soul;
another woman has poisoned my body;
neither of them came to look for me;
and I do not complain about either one.
Since it is round, the world rotates.
If now, as it rotates, this poison
poisons others, why blame me?
Can I give more than they gave me?
Why do you tell me? I know: she is flighty,
she is arrogant, vain and capricious;
before her soul shows compassion,
water will flow from a barren rock.
I know that in her heart, a nest of snakes,
there is nothing that responds to love;
that she is a lifeless statue; however
She is so beautiful!
¡La vida es sueño!Calderón.
With a flash of lightning we are born,
and its light is still glowing when we die:
our life is that short!
The glory and the love we chase after
are shadows of a dream that we pursue.
Death is an awakening!
[Melodía.Es muy triste morir joven, y no contarcon una sola lágrima de mujer]
When my hours of sickness
and insomnia are evident,
on the side of my bed,
who will sit down?
When I am about to expire
and I stretch out a trembling hand,
searching for another hand,
who will clasp it?
When death turns the surface
of my eyes glassy,
and my eyes are still open,
who will close them? 
While the bell tolls
(if it tolls at my funeral),
when they hear it,
who will say a prayer?
When my pallid remains
are covered by the earth,
above the forgotten grave,
who will come to weep?
Who, then, on another day
when the sun shines again,
that I lived in this the world,
who will remember?
Sometimes I encounter her in public
and she passes by me;
she walks by me smiling, and I say:
How can she smile?
Then another smile appears on my lips,
a mask to hide my pain,
and so I think: Perhaps her smile
is the same as mine!
I will die before you: still hidden
inside my heart
is the blade that, wielded by your hand,
opened the mortal wound.
I will die before you; and my spirit,
seated at the door of death
with stubborn determination, will be waiting
for your arrival. 
Hours turn to days, days turn to years
which then fly by,
and you will finally knock at that door
Does anyone not knock?
Then the earth will swallow your guilt
and your remains,
cleansing you with the waters of death,
as in another Jordan;
there where the murmur of life
finally dies,
like the wave that reaches the shore
to silently expire;
there where the tomb is sealed,
an eternity opens
and all that we have both kept silent
we will have to admit!
A tear appeared in her eyes
and I started to say I was sorry;
her pride spoke and her tears dried up,
and the words died on my lips. 
Now I go my way, and she goes hers;
but when I think about our shared love,
I still wonder: Why was I silent that day?
and she must say: Why didnt I cry?
The dawn moans softly and kisses
the gentle waves as they float by;
the sun kisses the cloud in the East,
and tints it with purple and gold;
the flame slips around the burning
trunk so it can kiss another flame,
and even the willow bends down
to kiss the river that has kissed it.

[Tú y yo.
Melodía.]
A floating cloud of light mist,
a curling wave of white foam,
an insistent murmur,
a golden harp,
a kiss of dawn, a beam of light,
that is what you are.
You, an ethereal shadow that vanishes
when I try to touch you,
like a flame, like a sound,
like a cloud, like a ripple
on the blue lake.
A noisy wave on the boundless sea;
in the void, an errant comet;
the haunting lament
of the roaring wind,
a constant longing for something better,
that is what I am.
I, who in my torment, rest my eyes
on your eyes both night and day;
I, who tirelessly and madly chase
after a shadow, the passionate creature
of a vision!
I can read what is in your eyes
as though in an open book;
so why do your lips feign laughter
that is denied by your eyes?
Go ahead and cry! Dont be ashamed
to confess that you loved me a little.
Go on, cry; no one is looking!
See, Im a man and I am crying too!
Like a swarm of angry bees,
in the dark corner of my memory
my recollections of the past
begin to pursue me.
I try in vain to drive them away!
They pursue me relentlessly,
and one after another they sting me
with a sharp prick that infects my soul.
Like a miser guards his treasure,
I protected my pain;
I tried to prove there is something eternal
to the one who promised me her eternal love.
But now I plead with her in vain, and I hear
her say it has ended:
Ah, you sad piece of clay, not even
your suffering is eternal!
Like a breeze that cools the blood
on the dark field of battle,
she wanders through the silent night
full of perfumes and harmonies;
a symbol of pain and tenderness,
in the tragic drama of the English bard,
sweet Ophelia, having lost her mind,
passes by picking flowers and singing.
Like one pulls the blade from a wound,
I tore my love for her out of my heart
although as I did it, I felt that my life
was torn out with it.
I removed her image from the pedestal
which my love had erected in my soul,
and the light of faith that had burned on it
was extinguished before the empty altar. 
But her stubborn vision still entered my mind
to struggle against my firm determination
When will I be able to sleep, with this dream
which keeps me awake!
How can that rose survive, which you have
pinned next to your heart?
Until now, I have never looked upon
a flower over a volcano.
She walks quietly and her movements are
silent harmony;
her steps are heard, and they resemble
the rhythmic cadence of a glorious hymn.
She partly opens her eyes, those eyes
as bright as day;
and all that heaven and earth encloses
burns with a new light in her eyes.
She laughs, and her laughter sounds
like running water;
She cries, and each tear is a poem
of infinite tenderness.
She has the light, the aroma
the warmth and the shape;
her figure, the birth place of desires,
her language, an eternal source of poetry.
She seems stupid? Bah! While she is silent,
she hides an obscure enigma;
what she keeps silent, in my opinion, is worth
more than what anyone else says.
At night when you are cradled
by the silken wings of sleep,
and your curved eyelashes
appear like ebony arches,
to be able to hear the beats
of your restless heart
and then to lean your sleeping
head on my breast,
my dear, I would give,
all that I possess:
light, air
and thought!
When your eyes are fixed
on an invisible object,
and your lips are lighted
by the hint of a smile, 
to be able to read on your
face the silent thoughts
that pass like a cloud
above the mirror of the sea,
my dear, I would give
all that I desire:
fame, gold,
glory and talent!
When your voice is silent,
and your breath quickens,
when your cheeks light up,
and your black eyes are half-closed,
to be able to see the burning spark
of moist fire that shines through
your eyelashes, as it erupts
from the volcano of desires,
my dear, I would give,
for all that I hope:
faith, spirit,
earth and heaven!
When a hidden voice
murmurs amid the shadows,
and disturbs their sad tranquility,
if I hear it echo sweetly
in the depths of my soul,
tell me: is it the wind that moans,
or is it your sighs that speak
to me of love as they pass by?
When the red sunlight enters
my window in the morning,
and my love invokes your shadow,
if it seems like I feel the sensation
of another mouth touching mine, 
tell me: am I raving madly,
or is it a kiss that your heart
sends me in a sigh?
If in the light of day
and in the dark of night,
and in everything around
the soul that loves you
it seems I see and feel you,
tell me: is what I touch and see
a dream, or do you give me
your breath to drink in a sigh?
When they told me, I felt the chill
of a knife blade in my heart;
I leaned against the wall, and for a moment
I lost track of where I was.
Night descended on my spirit;
my soul was drowned in anger and in pity
And then I understood why one weeps,
and then I understood why one kills!
The cloud of grief passed painfully,
I managed to stammer a few words
and what could I do? he was a friend
he had done me a favor I thanked him.
When I see the blue horizon
vanish in the distance
behind a shimmering cloud
filled with gold,
it seems like I could rise from
this wretched earth
and float in the golden clouds,
dissolved into tiny
particles like they are.
When I gaze into the depths
of the sky at night
and see the stars tremble like shining
eyes of fire,
it seems like I could climb
to where they shine
and bathe in their light, and merge
with them in a kiss
of incandescent light.
In the sea of doubt through which I sail,
I hardly know what I believe;
nevertheless, these desires tell me
that I carry something
divine here inside me!
When you bow your wistful
face over your breast,
you make me think of
a fallen lily.
Because by granting you the purity
which is a heavenly symbol,
God created you, like the lily,
with white and gold.
As we remember the past and recall
those fleeting hours,
a teardrop shines on her black eyelashes
and it trembles, about to slide down.
Then, it finally slides and falls like a drop
of dew, as we realize
that we both feel a longing, today for yesterday,
and tomorrow for today.
How many times, next to the moss-covered
walls that hide it,
as night came to a close I heard the bell
that calls to matins!
How many times the silver moon cast
my mournful shadow,
next to that of the cypress tree that rose
over the stone walls.
When the pointed arch of the church
was wrapped in shadows,
how many times I saw the light of a lamp
flickering behind the windows!
Even though the wind whistled through
the openings in the tower,
amid voices of the chorus I could hear
her voice quite clearly.
On winter nights, if some timid soul
happened to pass through
the deserted plaza, when he saw me,
he quickened his pace.
In the morning, there once was
an old woman who said
I must be the soul of some dead sacristan
who passed away in sin.

of the atrium and the portal;
the nettles growing there were perhaps

with their blazing eyes,
but in time, they came to look on me
as an old friend.
The reptiles crawled along by my side
without being afraid.
I saw that even the silent saints of granite
were welcoming me!
Where do I come from? Seek the steepest
path you can find.
The trail of bloody footprints
on the bare rock,
the remains of a soul torn apart
by the sharp thorns,
will show you the path
that leads to my cradle.
Where am I going? Cross the darkest
and the saddest wasteland,
a valley of eternal snows and constant
melancholy mists.
Where you find a solitary stone
with no inscription,
where forgetfulness reigns,
there will be my tomb.
I would gladly give the best years
from the short time I have left to live
to know what you have said
of me to others.
And this mortal life and whatever
afterlife I may have, if I have one,
to know what you have thought
of me when you were alone.
I put aside the light and sat down
on the edge of my unmade bed,
silent, somber, my eyes fixed
motionlessly on the wall.
How long did it last? I dont know: at last,
when the horrible drunkenness of pain left me,
the light had gone out, and on my balcony
the sun was shining.
Nor, during that terrible time, do I know
what I was thinking, or what was happening;
all I remember is that I cried and I cursed,
and that on that night, I grew older.
There in the dusky alcove of the room,
Perchance forgotten by its owner now,
Silent beneath its covering of dust,
The harp was seen.
How many a song was slumbering in its strings,
As in some bird-breast sleeping on the boughs,
Waiting the snowy hand whose master touch
Shall waken it!
Alas, methought -- how often genius halts
And drowses thus within the bosom's depth,
Hoping to hear a voice, like Lazarus,
To say its message, -- "Soul, arise and walk!"
[Duerme]
I am afraid to see you awake;
asleep, I dare to look at you;
therefore, soul of my soul,
I watch you as you sleep.
You laugh while you are awake
and your restless lips resemble
red lightning flashes that snake
across a snowy sky.
Asleep, the corners of your mouth 
curve with a smile
that is soft like the luminous path
of a sun that is dying
So sleep!
Awake, you watch, and as you watch
your moist eyes shine
like a blue wave whose crest reflects
the sparkling sunlight.
As you sleep, a tranquil glow seeps
through your eyelids
like a transparent lampshade that emits
its soothing light
So sleep!
Awake, you speak, and as you speak
your vibrant words resemble
a rain of pearls that pours in torrents
into a golden cup.
Asleep, in the faint murmur of your
regular breathing
I hear a poem that my lovesick soul
can understand
So sleep!
I have placed my hand
over my heart, so that its beating
will not be heard and disturb
the solemn stillness of the night.
I have closed the blinds
of your balcony so that
the dawns intrusive light
will not awaken you
So sleep!
You say you have a heart, however
you only say that since you feel it beating.
That is not a heart; it is a machine
that makes noise as it moves.
[Dos y uno]
Two red tongues of fire
move closer when they wrap
around a trunk, and as they kiss
they form a single flame;
Two notes are plucked
from a lute at the same time,
and when they meet in space
they form a harmonious chord;
two waves come together
to expire on a shore,
and in breaking they are crowned
with a crest of silver;
two long bands of mist
rise up from the lake,
and as they meet in the sky
they form a white cloud;
two simultaneous ideas,
two kisses that sound in unison,
two echoes that merge,
those are our two souls.
On the unsteady keystone of the arch
whose stones were reddened by time,
was a gothic coat of arms carved
by a crude hand. 
Ivy was hanging over the crest
of the granite helmet and cast shadows
over the coat of arms, on which a hand
was holding a heart.
In the deserted plaza the two of us
stopped to look at it;
That, she told me, is the perfect symbol
of my constant love.
Alas! What she told me then is true:
true, that she would hold
my heart in her hand or someplace else
but never in her breast.
Amid the loud uproar of the revelry
the echo of a sigh
caressed my ears, like a distant
note of music.
I recognized the echo of that sigh,
formed by the same air I have breathed,
the scent of a hidden flower that grows
in a dark cloister.
My beloved of the moment asked me
affectionately, What are you thinking?
Oh, nothing But why do you cry? My sadness
is happy; it is the wine that is sad.
It is a question of words, and nevertheless,
after what happened,
neither you nor I were ever able to agree
whose fault it was.
It is too bad that the dictionary of love
does not explain
when pride is simply pride,
and when it is dignity!
A nameless feeling,
an indefinable essence,
I live within the formless
life of the idea.
I swim in the void,
I tremble in the suns fire,
I shiver in the shadows
and I float in the mists.
I am the golden spark
of the distant star;
I am the pale and serene
light of the full moon.
I am the burning cloud
that floats in the sunset;
I am the luminous track
of the wandering star. 
I am snow on the peaks,
I am fire in the sands,
a blue wave in the seas
and foam on the shores.
In the lute I am music,
aroma in the violet,
a fleeting light in the tombs
and ivy on the ruins.
I sing with the lark
and buzz with the bee,
I mimic the sounds
that are heard in the night.
I rumble in the torrent
and hiss in the spark,
and I flash in the lightning
and roar in the storm.
I laugh on the hillsides,
I whisper in the tall grass,
I sigh in the clear water
and cry on the dry leaf.
I ripple with the plumes
of smoke that slowly rise
and climb to the heavens
in an immense spiral.
In the golden threads
that spiders hang from trees,
I rock back and forth
in a fervent dream.
I run after the nymphs
that frolic naked
in the swift current
of the sparkling stream.
In the forests of coral
that shade the white pearls
in the Ocean, I pursue
the agile water nymphs.
In the hollow caverns
where the sun does not reach,
I mingle with the gnomes
and gaze on their riches.
I search for the traces
of forgotten centuries,
and I remember those empires
whose name is erased. 
I follow the dizzy course
of the rotating worlds,
and my eye encompasses
the entire universe.
I perceive those regions
where no sound reaches,
and where unborn stars
await the breath of life.
I am the bridge
that spans the abyss;
I am the unknown ladder
connecting heaven and earth.
In short, I am that spirit,
the unknown essence,
the mysterious fragrance
whose receptacle is the poet.
This framework of flesh and bones
has finally tired of carrying around
this crazy head, and I am not surprised;
although it is true that I am not old,
when I think of how I have lived
this life, it pains me to say
that the way I have lived it feels like
I have squeezed a century into each day.
So, if I were to die right now,
I could never say I have not lived;
though the garment looks new outside,
I know that, on the inside, it has aged.
Yes, it has aged, despite my lucky star!,
my painful determination shows that clearly;
because there is pain that leaves its scar
on the heart, but not on the forehead.
Tired of dancing,
red in the face and short of breath,
resting on my arm
she paused at one end of the hall.
Above the delicate
fabric over her heaving breast
a flower was swaying
steadily and sweetly back and forth.
As though in an ivory cradle
rocked by the sea and caressed by the wind,
perhaps it was sleeping
while soothed by the breath from her lips.
Oh—I thought—if only
I might allow time to slip by like that!
Oh, if flowers sleep,
what a beautiful dream!
Pretending realities
that are superficial,
Hope marches
in front of Desire;
and all its lies
are reborn, like the Phoenix,
out of its ashes.
Today like yesterday, tomorrow like today,
and always the same!
A dreary gray sky, an endless horizon,
and it goes on and on!
My heart is beating mechanically, like
a stupid machine;
my sluggish intellect sleeps in the corner
of my brain.
My soul longs for a paradise
and searches without hope;
a pointless effort, a wave that rolls on,
without knowing why. 
An incessant voice that sings the same song
with the same tone;
a drop of water that drips monotonously
and never stops falling.
This is how the days keep sliding by,
one after the other,
today the same as yesterday and all of them
without joy or sorrow.
Alas!, sometimes I feel a longing
my former suffering
Sorrow can be painful; but at least
to suffer is to live!
Today both earth and heaven smile on me;
today the sunlight reaches the depths of my soul;
today I saw her, I saw her, and she looked at me
Today I believe in God!
Their cloaks loosened,
their backs uncovered,
on the lintel of the doorway
two angels were watching.
I approached the iron bars
that guarded the entrance,
and far behind the double iron grates
I saw her white figure.
I saw her like an image
that appears in a dream,
like a dim and scattered ray of light
that swims in the shadows.
I began to feel a burning
desire that filled my soul;
like an abyss that beckons, that mystery
was drawing me closer!
But alas!, the angels with their
steadfast gaze seemed to be saying:
No one but God can cross
the threshold of this door!
Night came and I could not find refuge;
and I was thirsty! I drank my tears.
And I was hungry! I closed
my swollen eyes to die!
Was I in a dessert? Though in my ears
I could hear the loud voice of the crowds,
I was orphaned and poor The world was
empty for me!
Like a savage who hastily carves a god
from a block of wood with his awkward hand,
and then he kneels before his work,
that was what you and I did.
We gave actual shape to a phantom,
a ridiculous invention of the mind;
and once the idol was created, we sacrificed
our love on its altar.
Sighs are air and they return to the air.
Tears are water and they return to the sea.
Tell me, woman: when love is forgotten,
do you know where it goes?
Hiding in the shadows she wounded me,
sealing her betrayal with a kiss.
She threw her arms around my neck, and in cold
blood, stabbed me behind my back.
And now she continues happily on her way,
pleased, smiling, undaunted; and why is that?
Because the wound could not be seen
Because the corpse was walking!
My life is a wasteland:
every flower I touch loses its petals;
as I follow my fated path
someone keeps on planting evil
so that I will pick it.
Never say your lexicon is exhausted,
that for lack of content, the lyre is silent.
There may be no poets, but there will
always be poetry!
As long as rolling waves are caressed
by the kiss of light;
as long as the sun clothes the clouds
with fire and gold;
as long as the air can bring us
perfumes and harmonies;
as long as there is spring time,
there will be poetry! 
As long as science fails to discover
the origin of life,
and the sea or the sky holds an abyss
that defies explanation;
as long as Humanity continues advancing
toward an unknown goal;
as long as mankind has unsolved mysteries,
there will be poetry!
As long as the soul can be happy
without a smile on its lips;
as long as one is able to cry without
tears in ones eyes;
as long as heart and mind
keep on battling;
as long as there are hopes and memories,
there will be poetry!
As long as there are eyes that mirror
the eyes that look at them;
as long as sighing lips can respond
to lips that sigh;
as long as two souls can feel they are
joined in a kiss;
as long as there is a beautiful woman,
there will be poetry!
Sleepless I wandered in that limbo
where all objects lose their shapes,
mysterious spaces that separate
waking life from sleep.
Thoughts that silently revolved
in wheeling dance about my brain
little by little reduced their pace
to a slower time.
The reflection of the light that comes to the soul
in through the eyes was veiled by the lids;
but the world of vision was lit from within
by another light.
At this point there echoed in my ears
a wavering sound, confused like that
in a church when the faithful are ending their prayers
with a firm 'Amen'.
And I seemed to hear a delicate, sad
voice that called me by name from afar
and I smelt the smell of snuffed-out candles,
of damp and fragrant incense
Night came down, and in the arms
of oblivion I fell like a stone
into her deep breast, and waking cried:
"Someone I loved has died!"
Your rejection did not surprise me! In fact,
your brief affection surprised me more;
since, as for what really matters about me,
of that you never had a clue!
I do not know what
I dreamed last night;
the dream must have been unhappy,
because I still felt sad when I awoke.
As I sat up I noticed
my damp pillow,
and when I saw it for the first time
my soul felt a bitter-sweet pleasure.
It is too bad when
a dream makes us weep;
but this sadness makes me happy.
I know that I still have some tears!
Our passion became a tragic farce
in whose absurd plot
the mixture of comedy and seriousness
produced laughter and tears.
But the worst part of that play was
that, by the end of the act,
she had both tears and laughter,
and I had only tears!
Giant waves that break with a roar
on distant deserted shores,
wrap me in a sheet of foam
and carry me away!
Hurricane gusts that blow away
dry leaves from the lofty wood,
drag me in a whirlwind across the sky
and carry me away!
Storm clouds that the lightning breaks,
you tip with fire your tattered edges,
drag me through the darkening mists
and carry me away!
Have pity, take me where vertigo
will take my memory and my reason...
Have pity! I am frightened to be alone
with my grief, alone, alone!
Enveloped in her beauty she passed by,
and I let her keep on going;
nor did I turn to look at her, and nevertheless,
something whispered to me: It is her.
Why does the evening follow the morning?
I know not; I only know
that during one brief summer night
twilights were joined and she left.
[A ella. No sé...]
For a glance, the world;
for a smile, the heavens;
for a kiss, I dont know what
I would give for a kiss!
[Al amanecer]
First comes a dim hint of whiteness,
a trembling ray of light that crosses the sea;
then it sparkles and grows and spreads
in a burning explosion of clarity.
That brilliant light is happiness;
but this timid shadow is my grief;
Alas!; in the dark night of my soul,
when will it dawn?
What is poetry? you ask as you fix
your blue eyes on my eyes.
What is poetry? And you are asking me?
Poetry is you.
How beautiful it is to see the dawn
when it is crowned with fire,
and its kiss of flames
ignites the waves and inflames the air!
How beautiful it is, after the rain
on a sad, gray afternoon in autumn,
to fill you lungs
with the aroma of the moist flowers!
How beautiful it is, when the white
flakes of snow are quietly falling,
to see the red tongues
of of the flickering fire move back and forth.
How beautiful it is, when you are sleepy,
to sleep well and snore like a pig
to eat, and get fat! And what a shame it is
that only that is not enough!
Do you want to taste this delicious nectar
without the dregs?
Well, bring it to your lips, breathe it in,
and then set it aside.
Do you want us to preserve the pleasant
memory of this love?
Well let us love each other today, and tomorrow
let us say goodbye!
If your red lips are ever heated
by an invisible burst of air, you will know
that a soul that speaks through its eyes
can also kiss with a glance.
Arrow flying thru the heavens
shot off and crossing by chance,
no one ever ventures guesses
where it will tremblingly fall;
withered leaf of autumn forest
battered by southerly blast,
no one knowing in which hollow
it will happen soon to fall;
giant wave the wind and weather
twists and tosses out at sea,
rolling, passing, never knowing
on what beach it comes to fall;
light of wisps or vibrant haloes
shining, but only to fade,
not knowing which of their number
will shine on the last of all:
such am I, perhaps by hazard
crossing the earth come what may,
never knowing whence nor whither
my steps carry me today.
Can it be true that, when sleep touches
our eyes with its rosy fingers,
our spirit escapes from its prison
in a hurried flight?
Can it be true that, on gentle breaths
of nocturnal breezes, it rises into
empty space, a guest of the mists,
to meet with others?
And there, denuded of its human form,
there, with its earthly bonds broken,
it lives for a short time in the solitary
world of the idea?
And laughs and cries, and hates and loves
and leaves behind a trace of pain and joy,
similar to the trail left by a meteor
when it crosses the sky?
I am not sure if this world of visions
exists outside, or if it lives within us;
but I know that I know many people
whom I have never known!
[Serenata]
If the bluebells sway back and forth
on your balcony
and you think a gentle wind is sighing
as it passes by,
know that, hidden among the green leaves,
it is I who sigh.
If a mysterious sound is heard somewhere
behind your back,
and you think a distant voice has called you
by your name,
know that, amid the shadows that surround you,
it is I who call you.
If in the middle of the night your heart
is filled with fear
when you feel a hot breath blowing
on your lips,
know that, by your side, though invisible,
it is I who breathe
If only the story of our wrongs could be
written in a book,
and all that was omitted from its pages
could be erased from our souls;
The love I still feel for you, has left such
deep traces in my heart,
that if you were to remove only one,
I might remove them all!
You floated for a moment before my face,
and then the image of your eyes remained,
like a dark spot ringed by fire,
if one is blinded gazing at the sun.
Wherever I happen to fix my sight
I see your flaming eyes again;
but it is not you; it is only your gaze,
just your eyes, and nothing more.
I see them glowing in the corner
of my bedroom, disembodied and unreal;
when asleep I have the feeling they
are wide open, gazing upon me.
I know there are will-o-the-wisps at night
that lead the traveler astray;
I feel myself drawn by your eyes;
but where they draw me, I do not know.
You were the hurricane and I, the lofty
tower that defied its power.
You had to explode or tear me down!
It could never be!
You were the ocean and I, the upright
rock that firmly resisted its movement:
You had to break down, or wash me away!
It could never be!
You were beautiful and I, proud; the one
used to dominance, the other not to give in;
the path was narrow, the clash, inevitable
It could never be!
[Imitación de Byron]
Your eyes are blue, and when you laugh,
their soft splendor makes me think of
the brilliant morning sunlight
that is reflected on the sea.
Your eyes are blue, and when you cry,
the transparent teardrops in them
make me think of drops of dew
on a violet.
Your eyes are blue, and if in their depths
an idea glows like a point of light,
it makes me think of an evening star
swallowed by the sky.
One woman has poisoned my soul;
another woman has poisoned my body;
neither of them came to look for me;
and I do not complain about either one.
Since it is round, the world rotates.
If now, as it rotates, this poison
poisons others, why blame me?
Can I give more than they gave me?
Against my interests I must confess,
my beloved, that like you
I believe that an ode is only good
written on the back of a banknote.
When they hear this, some fools
will be shocked and say:
Oh, how materialistic and prosaic, typical
of the nineteenth century Nonsense!
Words spouted by a few poets who cloak
themselves with their lyre during the winter!
The barking of dogs who howl at the moon!
You and I both know that in this life,
there are few who have the talent to write it,
and with gold, anyone can make poetry.
I have delved into the deep chasms
of earth and heaven;
I have probed their depths, with my eyes
or with my mind.
But alas!, when I reached the abyss of a heart
and I leaned down to examine it,
my soul and my eyes became disturbed:
it was so deep and so black!
I know why it is
you sigh;
I know the cause of your sweet
hidden languor.
Are you laughing? Some day,
girl, you will know why;
perhaps you suspect it,
and I know it.
I know what you dream
and what you see in dreams.
On your face I can read like a book
what you do not say.
Are you laughing? Some day,
girl, you will know why;
perhaps you suspect it,
and I know it.
I know why you smile and cry
at the same time;
I can pierce the mysterious depths
of your womanly soul.
Are you laughing? Some day,
girl, you will know why;
while you feel a lot and know nothing
I, who no longer feel, know it all.
I know a giant, strange hymn 
that proclaims a dawn in the night of the soul
and these pages are cadences of that hymn,
cadences that the air spreads in the shadows.
I would like to write it, taming
man's rebellious and poor language
with words that would be at once
sighs and laughter, colors and tones.
But the struggle is in vain; there is no cipher
capable of containing it; and hardly, oh my beauty!
could I, holding your hands in mine,
softly sing it to you when we were alone.
"I am a passion; I am a flame;
I am a symbol of loves that go,
I am that desire which transcends shame
Is it I you seek?"
"Not you: no!"
"My brow is pale, my hair is gold;
I can make your dreams come true.
Treasures of tenderness I hold-
Is it I you call?"
"No: not you!"
"I am a mystery; I am a dream;
A fleeting phantom of light and gloom;
A mist; a shadow; not what I seem,
I cannot love you!"
"Oh, come, come!"
Cold and stormy the night I sailed from Montevideo.
As we rounded the Cerro,
I threw from the upper deck
a coin that glinted and winked out in the muddy water,
a gleam of light swallowed by time and darkness.
I felt I had committed an irrevocable act,
adding to the history of the planet
two endless series, parallel, possibly infinite:
my own destiny, formed from anxieties, love and futile upsets
and that of that metal disk
carried away by the water to the quiet depths
or to far-off seas that still wear down
the leavings of Saxon and Viking.
Any moment of mine, asleep or wakeful,
matches a moment of the sightless coin's.
At times I have felt remorse,
at others, envy
of you, existing, as we do, in time and its labyrinth,
but without knowing it.
Welcome, the waters voice
To one whom black sand overwhelmed,
Welcome, to the curved hand
The smooth column of the marble,
Welcome, slender labyrinths of water
Between the lemon trees,
Welcome the melodious zéjel,
Welcome is love, welcome the prayer
Offered to a God who is One,
Welcome the jasmine.
Vain the scimitar
Against the long lances of the host,
Vain to be the best.
Good to know, foreknow, grieving king,
That your courtesies are farewells,
That the key will be denied you,
The infidels cross eclipse the moon,
The afternoon you gaze on prove your last.
Labyrinth, quibbles, emblems,
Such bleak laborious minutiae
Were all this Jesuit knew of poetry,
Which he had reduced to stratagems.
No music in his soul; but this inane
Herbarium of metaphors and punning
And a veneration of cunning 
And contempt for the human and superhuman.
Homer's ancient voice he never heard,
Or the voicesilver and moonlightof Virgil;
Nor saw Oedipus the accursed in exile
Nor Christ who is dying on a piece of board.
The stars, the radiant eastern stars
That in the vast aurora slowly fade, 
Of these he blasphemously said
Chickens of the celestial acres.
As ignorant of divine love he was
As of that other burning in the bone;
The Pale One surprised him one afternoon
As he was reading El Marino's stanzas.
His later destiny is not given;
The dust that yesterday was his frame
Loosed to the changes of the tainted grave,
The soul of Gracián rose up to heaven.
What did he feel then contemplating plainly
The Archetypes and the Splendors?
Perhaps he cried and told himself: Vainly
I sought nourishment in shadows and errors.
What happened when the relentless
Sun of God, The Truth, put forth its fire?
Maybe the light of God left him blind there
In the center of the endless heavens.
I know another ending. Doped on his themes
Infinitesimal, Gracián never noticed heaven
And turns over in his memory as ever
Labyrinth, quibbles, emblems.
No one perceived the beauty
Of the habitual walks
Until the dreadful shout
And the aching contortion of the martyr
Flung himself down the complex greenish sky
In a reckless descent of water and of shadows
The unanimous storm
He struck the humiliation of the houses
And the world was loathsome to the looks
But when the gentle chest
Illuminated with its colors the sky
And the odor to the wet land
Encouraged the gardens
Throw themselves to walk the streets
Like for a revived country estate
And in the glass were generosities of the sun
And the lighted leaves that illustrate the woods
Said his quivering immoral summer.
Between my love and me three hundred nights
Like three hundred walls will have to be raised
And the sea shall be like magic between us.
Nothing will remain except memories.
O afternoons brought in with suffering,
The nights aspiring to see you,
The fields on my way, the firmament
That I am seeing and losing
Certain as marble
Your absence shall sadden other afternoons.
I have committed the worst of sins
One can commit. I have not been
Happy. Let the glaciers of oblivion
Take and engulf me, mercilessly.
My parents bore me for the risky
And the beautiful game of life,
For earth, water, air and fire.
I failed them, I was not happy.
Their youthful hope for me unfulfilled.
I applied my mind to the symmetric
Arguments of art, its web of trivia.
They willed me bravery. I was not brave.
It never leaves me. Always at my side,
That shadow of a melancholy man.
Not a star will remain in the night.
The night itself will not remain.
I will die and with me the sum
Of the intolerable universe.
Ill erase the pyramids, the coins,
The continents and all the faces.
Ill erase the accumulated past.
Ill make dust of history, dust of dust.
Now I gaze at the last sunset.
I am listening to the last bird.
I bequeath nothingness to no-one.
The labyrinth is lost. Lost too
all those lines of eucalyptus,
the summer awnings and the vigil
of the incessant mirror, repeating
the expression of every human face,
everything fleeting. The stopped
clock, the tangled honeysuckle,
the arbour, the frivolous statues,
the other side of evening, the trills,
the mirador and the idle fountain
are things of the past. Of the past?
If theres no beginning, no ending,
and if what awaits us is an endless
sum of white days and black nights,
we are already the past we become.
We are time, the indivisible river,
are Uxmal, Carthage and the ruined
walls of the Romans and the lost
park that these lines commemorate.
They let fall the book, when they see
that they are the ones in the book.
(They will be in another, greater,
but what can that matter to them.)
Now they are Paolo, Francesca,
not two friends who are sharing
the savour of a fable.
They gaze with incredulous wonder.
Their hands do not touch.
Theyve discovered the sole treasure;
They have found one another.
They betray no Malatesta,
since betrayal requires a third
and they are the only two on earth.
They are Paolo and Francesca
and the queen and her lover too
and all the lovers whove been
since Adam went with Eve
in the Paradise garden.
A book, a dream reveals
that they are forms in a dream once
dreamt in Brittany.
Another book will ensure that men,
dreams also, dream of them.
The silent friendliness of the moon
(misquoting Virgil) accompanies you
since that one night or evening lost
in time now, on which your restless
eyes first deciphered her forever
in a garden or patio turned to dust.
Forever? I know someone, someday
will be able to tell you truthfully:
Youll never see the bright moon again,
Youve now achieved the unalterable
sum of moments granted you by fate.
Useless to open every window
in the world. Too late. Youll not find her.
We live discovering and forgetting
that sweet familiarity of the night.
Take a long look. It might be the last.
For María Kodama
There is such solitude in that gold.
The moon of these nights is not the moon
The first Adam saw. Long centuries
Of human vigil have filled her with
An old lament. See. She is your mirror.
Of that knight with the sallow, dry
Complexion and heroic bent, they guess
That, always on the verge of adventure,
He never sallied from his library.
The precise chronicle of his urges
And its tragic-comical reverses
Was dreamed by him, not by Cervantes,
Its no more than a chronicle of dream.
Such my fate too. I know theres something
Immortal and essential that Ive buried
Somewhere in that library of the past
In which I read the history of the knight.
The slow leaves recall a child who gravely
Dreams vague things he cannot understand.
Of these streets that deepen the sunset,
There must be one (but which) that Ive walked
Already one last time, indifferently
And without knowing it, submitting
To One who sets up omnipotent laws
And a secret and a rigid measure
For the shadows, the dreams, and forms
That work the warp and weft of this life.
If all things have a limit and a value
A last time nothing more and oblivion
Who can say to whom in this house
Unknowingly, we have said goodbye?
Already through the grey glass night ebbs
And among the stack of books that throws
A broken shadow on the unlit table,
There must be one I will never read.
In the South theres more than one worn gate
With its masonry urns and prickly pear
Where my entrance is forbidden
As it were within a lithograph.
Forever theres a door you have closed,
And a mirror that waits for you in vain;
The crossroad seems wide open to you
And there a four-faced Janus watches.
There is, amongst your memories, one
That has now been lost irreparably;
Youll not be seen to visit that well
Under white sun or yellow moon.
Your voice cannot recapture what the Persian
Sang in his tongue of birds and roses,
When at sunset, as the light disperses,
You long to speak imperishable things.
And the incessant Rhone and the lake,
All that yesterday on which today I lean?
They will be as lost as that Carthage
The Romans erased with fire and salt.
At dawn I seem to hear a turbulent
Murmur of multitudes who slip away;
All who have loved me and forgotten;
Space, time and Borges now leaving me.
At evening
they grow weary, the patios two or three colours.
Tonight, the moon, bright circle,
fails to dominate space.
Patio, channel of sky.
The patio is the slope
down which sky flows into the house.
Serene,
eternity waits at the crossroad of stars.
Its pleasant to live in the friendly dark
of entrance-way, arbour, and cistern.
From the generations of roses
That are lost in the depths of time
I want one saved from oblivion,
One spotless rose, of all things
That ever were. Fate permits me
The gift of choosing for once
That silent flower, the last rose
That Milton held before him,
Unseen. O vermilion, or yellow
Or white rose of a ruined garden,
Your past still magically remains
Forever shines in these verses,
Gold, blood, ivory or shadow
As if in his hands, invisible rose.
At evening
they grow weary, the patios two or three colours.
Tonight, the moon, bright circle,
fails to dominate space.
Patio, channel of sky.

One spotless rose, of all things
That ever were. Fate permits me
The gift of choosing for once
That silent flower, the last rose
That Milton held before him,
Unseen. O vermilion, or yellow
Or white rose of a ruined garden,
Your past still magically remains
Forever shines in these verses,
Gold, blood, ivory or shadow
As if in his hands, invisible rose.
They let fall the book, when they see
that they are the ones in the book.
(They will be in another, greater,
but what can that matter to them.)
Now they are Paolo, Francesca,
not two friends who are sharing
the savour of a fable.
They gaze with incredulous wonder.
Their hands do not touch.
Theyve discovered the sole treasure;
They have found one another.
They betray no Malatesta,
since betrayal requires a third
and they are the only two on earth.
They are Paolo and Francesca
and the queen and her lover too
and all the lovers whove been
since Adam went with Eve
in the Paradise garden.
A book, a dream reveals
that they are forms in a dream once
dreamt in Brittany.
Another book will ensure that men,
dreams also, dream of them.
Between my love and me three hundred nights
Like three hundred walls will have to be raised
And the sea shall be like magic between us.
Nothing will remain except memories.
O afternoons brought in with suffering,
The nights aspiring to see you,
The fields on my way, the firmament
That I am seeing and losing
Certain as marble
Your absence shall sadden other afternoons.
Cold and stormy the night I sailed from Montevideo.
As we rounded the Cerro,
I threw from the upper deck
a coin that glinted and winked out in the muddy water,
a gleam of light swallowed by time and darkness.
I felt I had committed an irrevocable act,
adding to the history of the planet
two endless series, parallel, possibly infinite:
my own destiny, formed from anxieties, love and futile upsets
and that of that metal disk
carried away by the water to the quiet depths
or to far-off seas that still wear down
the leavings of Saxon and Viking.
Any moment of mine, asleep or wakeful,
matches a moment of the sightless coin's.
At times I have felt remorse,
at others, envy
of you, existing, as we do, in time and its labyrinth,
but without knowing it.
Welcome, the waters voice
To one whom black sand overwhelmed,
Welcome, to the curved hand
The smooth column of the marble,
Welcome, slender labyrinths of water
Between the lemon trees,
Welcome the melodious zéjel,
Welcome is love, welcome the prayer
Offered to a God who is One,
Welcome the jasmine.
Vain the scimitar
Against the long lances of the host,
Vain to be the best.
Good to know, foreknow, grieving king,
That your courtesies are farewells,
That the key will be denied you,
The infidels cross eclipse the moon,
The afternoon you gaze on prove your last.
For María Kodama
There is such solitude in that gold.
The moon of these nights is not the moon
The first Adam saw. Long centuries
Of human vigil have filled her with
An old lament. See. She is your mirror.
I have committed the worst of sins
One can commit. I have not been
Happy. Let the glaciers of oblivion
Take and engulf me, mercilessly.
My parents bore me for the risky
And the beautiful game of life,
For earth, water, air and fire.
I failed them, I was not happy.
Their youthful hope for me unfulfilled.
I applied my mind to the symmetric
Arguments of art, its web of trivia.
They willed me bravery. I was not brave.
It never leaves me. Always at my side,
That shadow of a melancholy man.
The silent friendliness of the moon
(misquoting Virgil) accompanies you
since that one night or evening lost
in time now, on which your restless
eyes first deciphered her forever
in a garden or patio turned to dust.
Forever? I know someone, someday
will be able to tell you truthfully:
Youll never see the bright moon again,
Youve now achieved the unalterable
sum of moments granted you by fate.
Useless to open every window
in the world. Too late. Youll not find her.
We live discovering and forgetting
that sweet familiarity of the night.
Take a long look. It might be the last.
Labyrinth, quibbles, emblems,
Such bleak laborious minutiae
Were all this Jesuit knew of poetry,
Which he had reduced to stratagems.
No music in his soul; but this inane
Herbarium of metaphors and punning
And a veneration of cunning 
And contempt for the human and superhuman.
Homer's ancient voice he never heard,
Or the voicesilver and moonlightof Virgil;
Nor saw Oedipus the accursed in exile
Nor Christ who is dying on a piece of board.
The stars, the radiant eastern stars
That in the vast aurora slowly fade, 
Of these he blasphemously said
Chickens of the celestial acres.
As ignorant of divine love he was
As of that other burning in the bone;
The Pale One surprised him one afternoon
As he was reading El Marino's stanzas.
His later destiny is not given;
The dust that yesterday was his frame
Loosed to the changes of the tainted grave,
The soul of Gracián rose up to heaven.
What did he feel then contemplating plainly
The Archetypes and the Splendors?
Perhaps he cried and told himself: Vainly
I sought nourishment in shadows and errors.
What happened when the relentless
Sun of God, The Truth, put forth its fire?
Maybe the light of God left him blind there
In the center of the endless heavens.
I know another ending. Doped on his themes
Infinitesimal, Gracián never noticed heaven
And turns over in his memory as ever
Labyrinth, quibbles, emblems.
No one perceived the beauty
Of the habitual walks
Until the dreadful shout
And the aching contortion of the martyr
Flung himself down the complex greenish sky
In a reckless descent of water and of shadows
The unanimous storm
He struck the humiliation of the houses
And the world was loathsome to the looks
But when the gentle chest
Illuminated with its colors the sky
And the odor to the wet land
Encouraged the gardens
Throw themselves to walk the streets
Like for a revived country estate
And in the glass were generosities of the sun
And the lighted leaves that illustrate the woods
Said his quivering immoral summer.
Not a star will remain in the night.
The night itself will not remain.
I will die and with me the sum
Of the intolerable universe.
Ill erase the pyramids, the coins,
The continents and all the faces.
Ill erase the accumulated past.
Ill make dust of history, dust of dust.
Now I gaze at the last sunset.
I am listening to the last bird.
I bequeath nothingness to no-one.
The labyrinth is lost. Lost too
all those lines of eucalyptus,
the summer awnings and the vigil
of the incessant mirror, repeating
the expression of every human face,
everything fleeting. The stopped
clock, the tangled honeysuckle,
the arbour, the frivolous statues,
the other side of evening, the trills,
the mirador and the idle fountain
are things of the past. Of the past?
If theres no beginning, no ending,
and if what awaits us is an endless
sum of white days and black nights,
we are already the past we become.
We are time, the indivisible river,
are Uxmal, Carthage and the ruined
walls of the Romans and the lost
park that these lines commemorate.
Little fleece of my flesh
that I wove in my womb,
little shivering fleece,
sleep close to me!.
The partridge sleeps in the clover
hearing its heart beat.
My breathing will not wake you.
Sleep close to me!.
Little trembling blade of grass
astonished to be alive,
don't leave my breast.
Sleep close to me!.
I who have lost everything
am now afraid to sleep.
Don't slip away from my arms.
Sleep close to me!
He passed by with another;
I saw him pass by.
The wind ever sweet
and the path full of peace.
And these eyes of mine, wretched,
saw him pass by!
He goes loving another
over the earth in bloom.
The hawthorn is flowering
and a song wafts by.
He goes loving another
over the earth in bloom!.
He kissed the other
by the shores of the sea.
The orangeblossom moon
skimmed over the waves.
And my heart's blood did not taint
the expanse of the sea!.
He will go with another
through eternity.
Sweet skies will shine.
(God wills to keep silent).
And he will go with another
through eternity!
You shall love beauty, which is the shadow of God over the Universe.
There is no godless art. Although you love not the Creator, you shall bear witness to Him creating His likeness.
You shall create beauty not to excite the senses but to give sustenance to the soul.
You shall never use beauty as a pretext for luxury and vanity but as a spiritual devotion.
You shall not seek beauty at carnival or fair or offer your work there, for beauty is virginal and is not to be found at carnival or fair.
Beauty shall rise from your heart in song, and you shall be the first to be purified.
The beauty you create shall be known as compassion and shall console the hearts of men.
You shall bring forth your work as a mother brings forth her child: out of the blood of your heart.
Beauty shall not be an opiate that puts you to sleep but a strong wine that fires you to action, for if you fail to be a true man or a true woman, you will fail to be an artist.
Each act of creation shall leave you humble, for it is never as great as your dream and always inferior to that most marvelous dream of God which is Nature.
To don Juan Contardi
The seafoam, endless, thick, so I couldnt find
the line where the sea dashed its wave at me.
The land I came to doesnt have spring:
it has its long night, in which I find no mother.
The wind at my house makes its round of laments
and howling; breaks, like a mirror, my shout.
And in the white prairies, the infinite horizon,
I gaze at the dying of immense sorrowful sunsets.
What to call her, she who has come
so far that only the dead have gone further?
The dead, so alone, study an ocean hushed and grow stiff,
frozen the arms of the dead, in the arms of those they love.
The ships whose sails fly white in the harbor
come from lands where my loved ones never have been;
their bright-eyed men dont know my rivers
and bring forth pale fruits without the light of my orchards.
And the question that rises in my throat
upon seeing them pass, falls, conquered:
they speak strange tongues and are not moved
by the words that my ancient mother sings in lands of gold.
I watch the snow as if the dust of graves;
I watch the mist form and grow like death throes,
and so as not to go mad I dont count the seconds,
because the long night now so lonely begins.
I watch the entraptured prairie, gather to me its pain,
I that came to see the mortal lands.
The snow is the semblance that appears in my mirror;
its whiteness will ever be, ever under the heavens!
Ever, she, grandly silent, like the lofty gaze
of God upon me; ever her bridal wreath laid over my house;
ever, like a fate that never fades nor comes to pass,
she will descend to cover me, terrible and ecstatic.
Sleep, sleep, my beloved,
without worry, without fear,
although my soul does not sleep,
although I do not rest.
Sleep, sleep, and in the night
may your whispers be softer
than a leaf of grass,
or the silken fleece of lambs.
May my flesh slumber in you,
my worry, my trembling.
In you, may my eyes close
and my heart sleep.
To doña lsaura Dinator
Little feet of children
blue with cold,
how can they see you and not cover you
dear God!.
Little wounded feet
cut by every stone,
hurt by snow
and mire.
Man, blind, does not know
that where you pass,
you leave a flower
of living light.
And where you set
your little bleeding foot,
the spikenard blooms
more fragrant.
Walking straight paths,
be heroic, little feet,
as you are
perfect.
Little feet of children,
two tiny suffering jewels,
how can people pass
and not see you!

And well!Here you are, before the dissecting table,
Where the horizon of the sciences
The extension of its limits swells.
Here, where rigid experience
Comes to dictate its superior laws
To which existence is subjected.
Here, where the celestial sphere
Spills its flares; the light which extinguishes
Distinctions between master and slave.
Here, where the fable goes silent
And the voice of deeds arises
And superstitions fade.
Here, where science makes haste
To read the solution of the problem
Which its very pronouncement scares.
She, who bears the reason through norm,
And on your lips, craves to hear
The august truth of the supreme voice.
Here it is now…after the impious fight
In which you managed to break the extremes,
The prison which held you into pain.
The light of your pupils no longer exists,
Your vital mechanism rests inert
Having resisted meeting its objectives.
“Misery and naught else!” they’ll say,
Who belief that life’s empire
Ends where death begins.
And supposing your mission ended
Will approach you, and in their eyes
They’ll send their eternal farewells.
But no!…Your mission isn’t complete here,
Nor is nothingness the point at which we are born,
Nor is nothingness the point at which we die.
Existence is circular and we do wrong,
When wanting to exact measurement
We assign as its limits the cradle and the grave.
The mother is solely the mold on which
We take our form, the evanescent form
With which we traverse the ungrateful life.
But neither that one forms the first
Which our being adorns, or is it
Its last, when it finally dies.
And there, onto life, in extraneous form,
you will return to the earth and to its bosom
that the focus is of universal life.
And there, to life, apparently alien,
Rain and summer’s power
Will make fecund with seeds your silt.
And rising from root to bud
You will go from the orchard to witness
Above ground the sovereign lab.
Perhaps returned changed as wheat,
To the same sad home, where the sad wife,
Who without bread, dreams of you.
In so far as the fissures of your fossa
Will see its depths open,
As larva turned to butterfly,
Which the trials of its uncertain flight
Will, to the unhappy bed of you loves,
Carry your death’s kiss.
And amid those internal changes,
Your cranium, full of a new life,
Instead of thoughts will bring forth flowering buds,
On which chalice, hidden will shine
The tear with which perhaps your love
Accompanied the farewell to your good bye.
The grave is the end of the journey,
Because the grave is where lies dead
The pent up flame of your soul.
But in that mansion, at which door
Our breath fades, there is another breath
Which again harkens us to life.
There strength and talent end,
There pains and pleasures end,
There faith and feeling end.
There terrestrial ties end,
And amassed the idiot and the sage
Sink into equalities’ terrain.
But there, where the spirit is depleted
And the mechanism dies, there
The being that perishes shoots forth another life.
The powerful and fecund abyss
Of the ancient organism takes hold,
And shapes and makes of the other an organic whole.
Abandon the righteous history,
And name without prudency, indifferent;
So may that name become eternal or simply end.
He, solely collects the mass
And changes objects, changes forms,
Takes charge, that it shall live perpetually forth.
The grave guards only bones,
But life, in its mortuary vault
Secretly Continues to feed.
That to the end of this transitory existence
To which our eagerness so much holds on to,
Matter, immortal like glory,
Changes forms; but never perishes.
Your voice will never die, your voice, your voice, your voice...
Your voice will continue to sound for ever
—ashes in the soil of life—,
your voice will continue to sound for ever
—your voice, your voice, your voice, your voice—
through the immense vault of the night;
your voice will continue to sound for ever
through the immense vault of my soul,
—your voice, your voice, your voice, your voice, your voice—
like the magic echoes of the stars...
Up there the bird is singing
and down here the water.
Up there and down here
it is my soul that opens.
The bird rocks the star,
the water rocks the leaf.
Up there and down here
it is my soul that trembles.
Night is leaving, black bull
—full flesh in mourning, in fright, in mistery—
bellowing terribly, immensely
to the sweating fears of all those lying down;
and day comes, fresh child,
asking for trust, love and laughter,
—child who, far away over there,
in the hidden places where the
beginnings and the ends meet,
has played for a moment,
in an unknown meadow
of light and shade,
with the bull as it runs away.—
We walk, in silence, through the cold park,
the fog making it unknown, immense, strange.
How alone everything is, and the two of us!
—Silence. Blindness. Silence.—
Suddenly a foggy sun,
—O, where was the sun?—
with the instant blue of the sunset,
gives to everything —was burning confusion!—
the spectral company of the shade.
Things you must light up for me
—always seen, never looked at;—
things I must see in you,
light of every day!
A leaf, transparent
with sun, where is it from?
A forehead that thinks,
a heart with a wish,
a river that sings,
where are they from?
Love; a rock in the water,
your foot, unseen,
your forehead —beautiful foot— in the mirror!
Love; a rock in the water,
your foot, unseen,
your forehead —beautiful foot— in the mirror!
Song, you are my life
and you will live;
and the throats singing your song
will sing eternity.
How the light of day
penetrates through my eyes to my soul!
My cave is dazzled,
as poor as it is, with glory
and seems suspended from living gold.
And my joy comes
out of her like a beautiful
daughter, naked, free,
in the happy stream of my song
that carries the dawn with it to infinity.
Things you must light up for me
—always seen, never looked at;—
things I must see in you,
light of every day!
A leaf, transparent
with sun, where is it from?
A forehead that thinks,
a heart with a wish,
a river that sings,
where are they from?
At this very instant
bodies have ceased to exist; there are only souls
that long for each other, want to see each other,
penetrate each other without end.
And this desire
never ends, for the power
of its fire is the orbit
of the soul: the universe.
Two universes
—O impossible possibility of love!—
mutually penetrating
with a desire for two eternities!
Both souls come out embracing
and depart; two bodies remain,
isolated, dead, cold!
This eagerness to dream
of when I could have
for ever, except now,
what I have now!
She used to talk in a different way from us all,
of things that were from here, but never said before
she mentioned them. She was everything:
Nature, book and love.
She would start always, like the dawn,
in an unforseen way,
so distant from everything dreamt!
She would reach her zenith, always,
like twelve o'clock, in a way
never suspected,
so distant from everything narrated!
She would keep silent, like the sunset,
in a unexpected way,
so distant from everything thought!
How distant, and how close
to me her body was! Her soul,
how distant and how close
to mine!
Nature, book and love.
Rain all about the green country-side
Rain all about the green country-side
What peace! The water opens
and the November grass
is like pale diamonds
The sungoes out; from the cabin
of the orchard, it is possible to see the valley
more green, more aroma
more ideal of the past
Rain; white poplar
it gets dark; the pine grove
removes itself; everything is gray
melancholy and fragrant
And the aching sunset
rise wander clearness
mauve, roses, yellow
of soft-as-silk and of the crystals...
Oh the rain is all about the green country-side!
What peace! In the air
the wet aromas come
of the violet autumn
Is everything nothing? Then, what of this complete joy
at going under the earth, fully finished
like a beautiful book?
And this full delight
at seeing oneself detached from life
as a perfect fruit from its branch?
And the solitary happiness
at having left in the invisible
the complete reality of desire
like a river parading towards the sea
its perennial sculpture?
Your voice will never die, your voice, your voice, your voice...
Your voice will continue to sound for ever
—ashes in the soil of life—,
your voice will continue to sound for ever
—your voice, your voice, your voice, your voice—
through the immense vault of the night;
your voice will continue to sound for ever
through the immense vault of my soul,
—your voice, your voice, your voice, your voice, your voice—
like the magic echoes of the stars...
White cloud,
broken wing —whose?—
that was unable to reach —where?—!
Night is leaving, black bull
—full flesh in mourning, in fright, in mistery—
bellowing terribly, immensely
to the sweating fears of all those lying down;
and day comes, fresh child,
asking for trust, love and laughter,
—child who, far away over there,
in the hidden places where the
beginnings and the ends meet,
has played for a moment,
in an unknown meadow
of light and shade,
with the bull as it runs away.—
Calm,
but inside like
the whirlpool of a river,
on the surface so calm,
what martyrdom, —what danger—
for the tortured heart!
A sky
where neither north nor south,
dawn or sunset
could be traced;
an even sky with twins lights,
identical colors, a single beauty;
desire alone —desires!—
marking the zenith!
We walk, in silence, through the cold park,
the fog making it unknown, immense, strange.
How alone everything is, and the two of us!
—Silence. Blindness. Silence.—
Suddenly a foggy sun,
—O, where was the sun?—
with the instant blue of the sunset,
gives to everything —was burning confusion!—
the spectral company of the shade.
Girl of delicately golden tresses,
girl obsession of the virgin stork
with tufts of damask feathers
that splashed death,
of the crazy stork with wings
of golden strychnine
which flew off leaving you with a corporeal perfume,
a neat smell of lilacs, already golden and rude dreams.
Girl who obeyed the apostle scops owl
and the murky look of real eyes,
with puerile drawings of Selene and the rest.
Girl of non-existent concert,
girl of cruel sonatines and malevolent books by Tom Wolfe,
or witch lace to bandage wounded deer ulcers,
of fallow deer gazing from mystical knolls,
or places like that.
Pluperfect girl, girl we never were,
tell it now,
tell it now, you, now that it’s so late,
spell out the sombre tempo,
spell me the tear
the purple silhouette of the mare,
the foal that lay at your feet waking up foam.
Abandoned recite the words of yesteryear,
shadow of Juan Ramón: Solitude, I am true to you.
Scornful recite the words of yesteryear,
but not that courtly verse,
don’t talk of queens white as a lily,
snow and Joan burning
and interwoven melancholy
of dear Villon,
speak clear verbs where you can drink the saddest liquid,
jars of sea and relief, now that it is already so late,
raise your tiny voice and summon up the song:
tell life that I remember her,
I remember her.
This small death is definitely lost in a nascent forest,
the shoot of an arrested comet,
that nobody saves
young volcano of novice gust and bones
made of bird, eyelid and thinking wave
no book painted with Italien solar gold,
no book of lava
will seal for me.
And so death so many times written
becomes radiant,
and i can talk
of desire and the unseeing beam of the lighthouse,
of the chimerical corpse of the crew.
And so death
becomes the story
of that mute girl who hanged herself
with boreal harp’s strings
because of nuptial poison on her tongue.
I definitely get lost cradling litters of rare epitaphs,
girl of golden tresses,
I will tell life that you remember her,
that you remember their lines conjuring your shadow,
that you remember their habits and tempo solo,
bitter laurel, deep bramble, brazen error and sorrowful hordes,
while Ephesian cats are crying at my feet,
while lost silver cats
go curdling their ancestry in genealogical cypress and poplar,
I will tell life to remember you,
to remember me now,
when I rise with loops and hair strings
up to the disaster of my head
up to the disaster of my twenty years,
up to the disaster, lammergeier light.
Now there approaches, sire, or now is here,
the glorious age for which heaven portends
one flock and one sole shepherd on this earth,
which happily for your own time's reserved.
Now so great a start, on this long trek,
shows you the object of your holy zeal
announcing to the world, as a reward,
one monarch, and one empire, and one sword.
Now the earthly sphere has seen in part—
and waits for all of it — your monarchy,
in which you, after righteous war, command:
for he to whom Christ gave His own device,
He'll also give the next, auspicious, day
on which, the oceans won, he'll win the land.
To my brother Juan de Dios Peza
When everything was flowers along your way,
when everything was birds in your surroundings,
yielding from your course to the slope
everything was fleeting and sudden in you.
Winter came with its mists, wine,
the ice that today makes your flow stagnant,
and in such a sad and strange situation
not even a pallid sun gives you a destiny.
And so in life the incessant flight
while everything is illusion, advances
in just one hour the scope of the sky.
And when the duel appears in the distance
then like you, changed in ice,
it can neither reflect nor hope.
When your bud barely half-opened
Aspires to good fortune and happiness,
Do you already bend tired and breathless,
Giving yourself over to pain and despair?
Do you not see that the vile shadow
Which blackens the firmament's blue,
Is only a cloud which will at the blow
Of the wind, again let you see the day?...
Wake up and rise!... The time is not yet here
When deep within your heart,
You yield to the pain that humbles you.
Unjust to the sun is your accusation
That the shadow which passes and blinds you
Is darkness, for night hasn't arrived yet.
To Rosario
Well then! I must say to you
that I adore you,
Say that I love you
with all my heart;
That I suffer
and cry aplenty,
That I cant bear this much;
and this imploring scream,
Implores you and seeks you out,
on my last illusions behalf.
I want you to know
that for many days now,
Ive been ill and pallid
with sleeplessness;
That my nights are dark,
so dark, and somber,
That all my hopes
have perished,
That Ive lost track even
of whence the future rose.
At night, when I lay
my temples on the pillow
And towards another world
my soul seeks to return,
I walk much, so much,
and at the journeys end,
My mothers forms
become lost in nothingness,
And your image
to my soul returns.
I understand your kisses
shall never be mine,
I understand that in your eyes
I shall never see myself;
And I adore you,
and in my mad and burning deliriums
I bless your disdain,
and your deflections love,
For instead of adoring you less thereby,
my love for you further grows.
And at times I wish to confer
to you my eternal farewell,
Erase you from my memory,
and from this passion flee;
But all in vain,
for the soul cannot forget you;
Bit of my life,
what would you have me do,
What would you have me do
with this heart of mine?
And then,
after the shrine was finalized,
Your burning flambeau,
your veil on the altar,
And the mornings sun
behind the bell tower,
The sparkling torch,
the smoking censer,
And already in the distance,
the homes doors opened wide¦
How beautiful it would have been,
for both of us
To have lived united
and enamored underneath that roof;
You always loving,
and I always satisfied,
Both of us one breast,
both of us a single soul,
And between us,
my mother like a God.
Imagine how beautiful
the hours of life would have been!
How sweet and gorgeous
our terrestrial journey
In likewise manner wouldve been!
And I dreamed of that,
my sweet betrothed;
And hallucinating in so much,
with a rattled soul,
I thought of being good for you, only you.
God knows that was
my most gorgeous dream,
My desire and my hope,
my elation and my bliss;
God knows that I figured
all my determination
In naught else but to love you
in that joyous home
Which enveloped me
in its kisses from my birth!
That was my hope¦
but since the deep abyss
That divides us
opposes its scintillating light,
Good bye for the last time,
love of my life;
Light of my darkness,
my flowers essence;
The poets lyre,
my very youth, good bye!
Without tears, without complaints,
without farewells, without a sob!
We carried on until the last... fortune
brought us here with the same objective,
we both came to bury the soul
beneath the tomb of scepticism.
Without tears... tears have no power
to bring a cadaver back to life;
our flowers fall and they turn
but at least in the turning, they leave
us with dry sight and a firm conscience.
Now you see it! for your soul and mine
spaces and the world are deserts¦
we have concluded both,
covered with sadness and affliction,
were not at the end, were just two corpses
in search of the shroud of forgetting.
Children and dreamers when we
barely left the cradle,
pain, still alien to our lives
slipping along sweet and serene
like a swans wing in a lagoon;
when the dawn of the first caress
hasnt yet peeked beneath the veil
that the virginal ignorance of the child
extends between his eyelids and the sky
your soul like mine,
in its clock advancing the hour
and in their darknesses lighting the day,
they saw a panorama that opened
beneath a kiss and at that dawns light;
and feeling, upon seeing that countryside
the wings of a supreme force,
we opened them early, and early
they brought us to the end of the voyage.
We gave to earth
the tints of love, and of the rose;
to our garden nests and songs
to our heaven birds and stars;
we used up the flowers on the road
to fashion from them
a crown for the angel of destiny...
and today in the midst of sad discord
of such an agonized or dead flower
one lifts only the pale and deserted
bloom that is poisoned by memory.
From the book of life
what we write today is the last page...
Lets close it at once
and in the sepulchre of lost faith
we will also bury our anguish.
And since heaven now concedes that
these evils are our last
so the soul can prepare to rest,
although the final tear cost us
we saw the task through to the end.
And afterward, when the angel of forgetting
has delivered these ashes
that guard the painful memory
of so many illusions smashed to bits
and of so much vanished pleasure,
well leave these spaces and return
to the tranquil life of earth,
now that the night of early pain
advances toward and encloses us
in the sweet horizons of tomorrow.
Lets leave these spaces or if you
want to, we can try out our breath,
a new journey to that blessed region
whose only memory resuscitates
the cadaver of the soul, upon feeling.
Lets throw ourselves off this world then,
where everything is shadow and void,
well make a moon from memory
if the sun of our love has grown cold;
well fly if you like,
to the depths of those magic regions
and pretending hopes and illusions
well smash the tomb and rising
on our bold and powerful flight,
we will form a heaven between shadows
and we will be the owners of that heaven.
To my brother Juan de Dios Peza
When everything was flowers along your way,
when everything was birds in your surroundings,
yielding from your course to the slope
everything was fleeting and sudden in you.
Winter came with its mists, wine,
the ice that today makes your flow stagnant,
and in such a sad and strange situation
not even a pallid sun gives you a destiny.
And so in life the incessant flight
while everything is illusion, advances
in just one hour the scope of the sky.
And when the duel appears in the distance
then like you, changed in ice,
it can neither reflect nor hope.
When your bud barely half-opened
Aspires to good fortune and happiness,
Do you already bend tired and breathless,
Giving yourself over to pain and despair?
Do you not see that the vile shadow
Which blackens the firmament's blue,
Is only a cloud which will at the blow
Of the wind, again let you see the day?...
Wake up and rise!... The time is not yet here
When deep within your heart,
You yield to the pain that humbles you.
Unjust to the sun is your accusation
That the shadow which passes and blinds you
Is darkness, for night hasn't arrived yet.

Your widow life will adorn that day in jewels...
In the wild charm of the village
Your arcane profile was a wound;
Unusual, alarming, it suggested
The enamel of a precious gem
Upon a mountainous breast.
Through the mouth of the open window sighed
All the orchard in bloom, and the sunny room
Was itself all the village;
Remember?... Upon me was projected,
More mortal than your shadow on the wall,
Your solemn sorrow of one gone astray...
Your hands, elongated by grasping toward fate,
All pale by trying to shroud dreams,
Seemed to touch me from a distance...
Your eyes were an infinite path
And new moons grew out below your eyes;
In only one kiss we became old...
—Oh, kiss!... flower of four petals... two of knowledge
And two illumined by innocence
The chalice an abyss, enrapturing and somber.—
By a miracle of melancholy,
Marble or brass I shattered in your hand
Spilling my spirit, like a pomander of essence.
Your widowed life will adorn that day in jewels...
My nostalgia has painted your Wagnerian profile
Upon the tremendous veil of absence.
The moon is pallid and sad, the moon is bloodless and cold.
I imagine the half-moon as a profile of the dead...
And beyond the reknowned and praised pallor
Of Arab pearls, I prefer the rose in recent bud.
In a corner of this land with the colors of earth,
I adore this pale moon, I adore this death mask!
And at the altar of the night, like a flower inflamed,
Inebriated by strange perfumes, my soul resigns.
I know of lips withered with blasphemy and wine;
After an orgy they kiss her trace in the lane.
Insane ones who die kissing her image in lakes...
Because she is light of innocence, because white things
Illuminate her mysterious light, things taking on white,
And even the blackest souls become uncertainly bright.
I dreamt it impetuous, formidable, and ardent;
It spoke the imprecise language of the torrent,
It was a sea overflowing with madness and fire,
Rolling through life like an eternal fountain.
Afterwards, I dreamt it sad like a great sun setting
That facing the night turns its fiery head;
Then it laughed, and in its mouth as tender as a prayer
The soul of the fountain sounded its crystal.
And today I dream it vibrant and tender, laughing, and sad,
That it dresses all iris and darkness;
That, fragile like an idol and eternal like God,
Its majesty rises above all life:
And the kiss falls in fire to perfume its soles
In a fiery flower plucked by two
Rare ring that lightens
Rare ring that darkens
A deep amethyst,
A vesperian twilight
That in your matutinal platinum
A splendid artist mounted.
The future is made of fear...
Will your destiny be a finger
Of tempest or of calm?
To lighten you or to darken you,
If I could only slide you
Over one finger of my soul!
I don't know if my eyes or my hands
Sparked life in your portrait;
Human clouds, superhuman rays,
All your I of innate emperor
Rises to my eyes, in my hands.
For that, all in flames, I unbind
Hair and soul for your portrait,
And I open in bloom!... Then, sovereign,
Of shadow and light, your grave eyes
Say great things that I know and you know
And I let you die In my hands remains
A great stain, livid and somber
And in my melancholy you are born again
Formed by cold and remote stars!
I, the marble statue with a head of fire,
Cooling my temples in cold and white prayer
In a gesture of palm or of the star
Affix your body, that hypnotic jewel of alabaster
Sculpted with pure kisses and burnished by age;
Serene, like having the moon as a cuirass;
White, more than if you were the foam of race,
And from the tabernacle of your chastity,
Raise to me the deep lilies of your soul;
My shadow will kiss your shroud of calm,
Which rising, rising will enwrap me with you;
Then my flesh will be lost in yours
Then my soul will be diluted in yours
Then there will be glory and we will be a god!
—Love of white and cold,
Love of statues, lilies, stars, gods 
Give him to me, my God!
In silence I feel time passing,
Like a slow parade, cold and rhythmical...
Ah! When you are far away my whole life cries
And to the murmur of your steps even in dreams I smile.
I know you will return, that another dawn will shine
In my grave horizon like a somber frown;
There in my forest will live again your great sonorous smile
That gaily crossed it like the glass of a river.
One day, meeting sadly on the path,
In your pale hands I placed my destiny!
And no greater thing will anyone ever offer you!
My soul is before your soul like the sea before the sky:
Between them, like the shadow of a flight,
Storm and time, and life, and death will pass!
—Night's tent has ripped open to the East.—
Your spirit dawns marvelously;
Its light enters my soul as the sun enters a garden
—The full sun. It rains fire. —Your love tempts, it is the cave
Velvety with moss, the stream, the fruit,
The pleasurable fruit fully ripened like honey.
—The Angelus. Your hands are two still wings,
My spirit bends like a branch of lilies,
And my body covers you as subtle as a veil.
—The triumph of the night. From your most beautiful hands,
Flow all the shadows and all the stars,
And my body becomes as deep as the heavens!
Remember? The stream was the kind serpent
It flowed sadly and sadly like the cry of a blind man,
When in the gray stones where sorrow is rooted,
Like an immense lily, there arose your prayer.
My heart, the grayest and most serene stone,
Awoke in the caress of the stream, and then
It felt like the evening, with hands of a Mohammedan
There hung from it a rose of fire.
And while the serpent of the stream brandished
The divine poison of melancholy,
Touched by the sunset your head overwhelmed me,
I crowned it with a fatal kiss; in the current
I saw a corpse of fire passing by And madly
In your deep embrace, sorrow cast me to the ground.
To Julieta, over the grave of Julio.
The god sleeps in his glory under your protection, Julieta;
A spear of love blushes in your arm;
His berceuse was white, your berceuse is purple 
You were a rose in his bed, you are a lily on his grave.
—The serpents of the world, pointed, spy upon
The suspecting celestial doves in your flesh. —
The god sleeps, Julieta; his pillow is made of stars
Polished by your hand, and your shadow is his robe;
The sleepless watch of your star-gazing
In the night, sole rival of your charm.
—And the beautiful serpents, inflamed, meditate
On the soft doves that sleep upon your body.—
And the god will awake, no one knows what day,
No one dreams in what land of glorification.
If he fell asleep crying, may he smile upon awakening 
In the moon-white vase of your melancholy
Rescue, like a pink diamond, your heart.
And rescue him from everything upon your heart!
Love, the night was tragic and sobbing
When your golden key sang in my lock;
Then, the open door upon the gelid shadow,
Your figure was a stain of light and whiteness.
All was illumined by your diamond eyes;
Your lips of freshness drank in my cup,
And your fragrant head rested on my pillow;
Your impudence fascinated me and I adored your madness.
Today I laugh if you laugh, and I sing if you sing;
And if you sleep I sleep like a dog at your feet!
Today I carry even in my shadow your fragrance of spring;
And I tremble if your hand touches my lock,
And I bless the night sobbing and dark
That in my life your fresh mouth bloomed.
Their Idyll was a long smile with lips fourfold
In the warm bosom of golden Spring
They loved each other so that between their expert fingers
Palpitated the divine form of chimera.
In the radiant palaces of quiet afternoons
They spoke words that fall on the ear like a sob,
And kissed deeply, so that their souls were consumed!
The hours withered and fell like blossoms of gold.
And fate interposed her two icy hands
Ah, their bodies yielded, but their interwoven souls
Are the most intricate knot there ever was
Struggling with their mad and superhuman liaisons
The furies of life wrought so as to break their hands
And Ananke exhausted her supreme fingers
The golden anchor beckons, the blue sail rises
Like the wing of a dream unfolding to a new day.
Let us depart, my muse!
Beyond an anxious prow, the sea stretches itself out.
In the crystal clear East, Aurora's
Blushed beacon shines. Fantasy
Is donning a rare garment of gems
To wander brilliantly over the waves.
The blue sail
Unfolds its private oriflamme to Aeolus...
The supreme moment!...I tremble: do I know—
Oh God!—what awaits me in unseen worlds?
Perhaps a freshly picked bouquet of fragrant laurels,
The golden fleece, a diamond scepter,
A shipwreck, or the eternal crown of the Anointed Ones?...
The amazonian little princess, a vibratile filagree,
—Turquoise eyes sculpted of porcelain, little princess—
Called one night at my door with her small hands of iris.
And the trilling crystal of her voice was like an elegant flute:
—I know your life is gray.
I have the soul of a rose, the dew of budding flowers,
I come from a beautiful country
To be your sister and muse!—.
An arm of alabaster...then, in the sonorous carnation
Of her mouth, softest honey; in a cloud of gold and perfume
She surrounded me, brash horsewoman, like a deluge.
Oh honey, freshness, perfumer!...The sudden dream, the shadow
Which intoxicates...and when I wake, the sun that falls on my carpet
In a false ruby very red, and a false ringlet very blond.
O Muse, let the golden fountain vibrate
The rosy cup of your mouth with kisses;
From the harmonious foams let spring forth
Live, supreme, mysterious, eternal
The ideal lover, the one sculpted
In prodigies of souls and bodies;
He must be alive by force of dreaming,
As blood and soul are taken from me in my dreams;
He must be born to dazzle Life,
And he must be a new god!
The blue serpents of his veins
Are nourished by miracle in my mind
O Muse, let the golden fountain seal
The rosy cup of your mouth with kisses;
The ideal lover, the one sculpted
In prodigies of souls and bodies,
Rooting his superhuman nails
In my flesh, he sobs in my reveries:
—I want no other life than your life,
In you exist the supreme elements;
Leave me under the sky of your soul,
In the warm soil of your body!—
—O Muse, let the golden fountain seal
The rosy cup of your mouth with kisses!
I went along, alone, to the mystery beneath a sun of madness,
And you spilled your shadow upon me, pilgrim;
Your glance was kind, like a dark path,
Like a damp path covering the way.
Prodigal and fertile to me was your bag of tenderness:
I had the simplicity of bread, and the flame of wine;
But your soul in a fold of its astral raiment,
A burr of gold and shadow, bore off my destiny.
My hands, which your hands covered, never
Shall grow cold, and holding fast in the sweet close mesh
Of your caress, will never be able to caress!
In my body, a tower of memory and hope
With the feel of marble and the dream of wax,
Your shadow casts roses of fire in the hearth
And in my soul, a castle desolate and sounding
With patinas of tedium and moistness of tears,
Your shadow casts roses of snow in the hearth!
If life were love, how blessed it would be!
I want more life so to love! Now I feel
A thousand years of ideas are not worth
One blue minute of sentiment.
My heart was dying slowly, sadly...
Now it opens like a Phoebean flower:
Life rushes forth like a turbulent sea
Whipped by the hand of love.
My sorrow flies into the night, sad, cold
With its broken wings;
Like an old scar that continues to ache—
In the distant shade it dissolves...
All my life sings, kisses, laughs!
All my life is a flowering mouth!
I believed that your eyes were flooding the world
Opened like mouths in clamor So aching
That they seemed a heart broken in two ardent pieces
They were flowing from your enigmatic face
As two springs grave and poisonous
Forges of fire and shadow, your pupils! so deep
That I know not from where they spied me,
Round and obscure like distant and timid worlds.
Ah, your eyes so sad like two galleries
Opened to the west! And the shadowy paths
Of your dark-circled eyes where I traced my path!
I wrapped in a great gesture my horror like in a veil,
And I walked away believing that in the sky there appeared
The moist midnight of your starless gaze!
O you who sleep so deep you cannot wake!
Every night in mourning I come upon your pupils,
Miraculous in life, miraculous in death,
And in life and death eternally open.
Beneath a remnant of shade or silk lace of moon,
I drink their calm as I would a lagoon.
For depth, for silence, for goodness, for peacefulness.
Each one seeming a bed or a tomb.
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse,
Come, you who jumbles the deep enigmas
In the shivering of the warm pupils.
Who hollows out the amethyst riverbed
Of lived circles under her eyes 
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
Come, you, the one who imprints a solemn rhythm
Upon the trembling of the glacial tomb;
The one who sets the dismal tone
Of the deep utterance of tragic shadows.
Come, you, weary poet, who plucks
The lyre of silence: the strangest one!
The one of the long mute vibrations,
Who harmonizes with the sound of the soul!
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Come, come closer to me, that in my pupils
Yours may sink in tenacious sight,
That there may glimmer in them the sublime enigma
Of the hereafter, which frightens 
Come come closer to me pierce in my lips
Your cold lips of amber,
May I try in them the unknown taste
Of the enervating essence of your soul!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
In your chamber covered with reverie, make waste
Of flowers and of spiritual lights; my soul,
Shod in silence and dressed in calm,
Will go after you down the darkest path of this night.
Turn out the lights and behold things beautiful;
Close all doors and enter illusion;
Uproot from mystery a handful of stars
And cover with flowers, like a triumphal vase, your heart.
And you will wait smiling, and you will wait weeping! 
When my soul arrives, perhaps you will pray, thinking
That heaven sweetly spills over your chest...
For divine love sit upon a sofa of calm,
Or with the mystical lily that is its sword, my soul
Will make vanish one by one the roses of your bed!
Behold it, thus, over the dark foliage
Drawing its sovereign silhouette...
Does it not seem the premature blossom
Of a race which will live tomorrow?
So an unshakable, robust race
Sculpted with strokes on hard marble,
From the vast campaigns of the future
It will rout the human race.
Behold it, thus —crouched— in imperial
Calm, imposing frightful nakedness!
God!... Move that body, give it a soul!
See the greatness that sleeps in its form...
See it up there, wretched, defenseless,
Poorer than a worm, forever calm!
There was a chain strong like fate,
Sacred like life, sensitive like a soul;
I cut it with a lily and continue my journey
With the magnificent coldness of death With calm
Curiosity my spirit looks at its inner lake,
And the crystal of the dormant waters,
Reflects a god or a monster, masked in a
Tenebrous sphinx suspended in other lives.
A divine illusion? A profound memory?
It was a supreme moment at the gates of the world!
Destiny told me marvelously:
—Your temples are two live royal mountings:
Choose a crown, all go to your brow!—
And I saw them spring from the fertile hands,
Blooming and glorious, tragic and brilliant!
Colder than the marmoreal corpse of a statue,
I saw thorns, and flowers, and diamonds rolling,
Like the splendid accessories of an illusory chimera.
Afterwards it was a shining stream of golden stars;
—Take! —it said— they are kisses of miracle, between them
Like two warm lands your temples will bloom!
Like dying pupils, they rolled away and were extinguished
I walked into life, sweetly, dreaming
To sink my fertile temples into your pale hands!
I die strangely... It is not life that kills me
It is not death that kills me, nor is it love;
I die of a thought, mute as a wound...
Have you never felt such a strange pain
Of an immense thought that is rooted in life,
Devouring flesh and soul, and without blooming?
Have you never carried inside a dormant star
That was burning you wholly without shining?
Height of martyrdom!... To eternally bear,
Rending and arid, the tragic seed
Pierced in one's entrails like a ferocious fang!...
But to uproot it one day in a flower that would bloom
Miraculous, inviolable!... Ah, it would not be greater
To hold in one's hands the head of God!
A time ago, an already forgotten soul belonged to me
It was nurtured by my shadow Whenever I wished,
The golden fan of its laughter would open,
Or its cry would bleed another current;
A soul that I made flow, like long locks
Spilled upon my hands Flower of fire and wax,
It died from a sadness of mine So flexible it was,
So faithful, that at times I doubt if it ever could have been...
Like a great rising sun it illumined my life
And my soul opened to drink it like a flower of dawn;
Love! Love! Blessed be the redeeming night
In which your florid little hand knocked at my door.
My soul pulsated in the shadow like a jarred harp:
The waters of silence already open, at dawn
It sang with its potent voice, mysterious and sonorous.
My gloomy soul was a sleeping star!
Today all the hope that I lamented as dead,
Emerges to the wingèd life of the bird that awakens
Inebriated with a joy strong as sorrow;
And all things shine and pulsate, everything awakens and sings,
As if the rosy canopy of its holy and living light
Opened upon the world the dawn of my love.
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse,
Come, you who jumbles the deep enigmas
In the shivering of the warm pupils.
Who hollows out the amethyst riverbed
Of lived circles under her eyes 
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
Come, you, the one who imprints a solemn rhythm
Upon the trembling of the glacial tomb;
The one who sets the dismal tone
Of the deep utterance of tragic shadows.
Come, you, weary poet, who plucks
The lyre of silence: the strangest one!
The one of the long mute vibrations,
Who harmonizes with the sound of the soul!
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Come, come closer to me, that in my pupils
Yours may sink in tenacious sight,
That there may glimmer in them the sublime enigma
Of the hereafter, which frightens 
Come come closer to me pierce in my lips
Your cold lips of amber,
May I try in them the unknown taste
Of the enervating essence of your soul!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
Mounted in the night is the lake of your soul,
A cloth, one would say, of crystal and calm
Woven by the large spiders of wakefulness.
A skim of sacred water in alabaster vases;
A mirror of purity that brightens the stars
And reflects the abyss of life in a sky!
I am the wandering swan of the bloody trails,
I go staining the lakes and rising up in flight.
Eros, I want to guide you, blind Father...
From your almighty hands I ask for
His sublime body spilled in fire
Upon my body faint in roses!
The electric corolla that I now open
Offers the nectary of a garden of wives;
To his vultures in my flesh I offer
A whole swarm of roseate doves.
Give to the two cruel serpents of his embrace
My great feverish stem Absinth, honeys,
Spill on me from his veins, from his mouth 
Thus lying I am an ardent furrow
Where can be nurtured the seed
Of another lineage sublimely mad!
When you spill the gown of snow
Over the pure shoulders of your muse
I gather my dark petals
And I am the lily of light alabaster.
To your muse in rose, I open in rose;
My heart is honey, perfume, and fire;
And I live and die of a glorious thirst:
Your living blood should be water spilled on me.
When covered by a tulle of moonlight
It drinks calm and azure in the lake,
I am the swan that soars, dreaming;
And if in magnificent mourning you dress her
To wander along sad paths,
I am the light or the shadow of a stele
Medallion of the night with the image of the day
And wounded by the pearl of melancholy;
Home of the spirits, heart of the azure,
The sadness of a bride in her tower of tulle;
Mask of mystery or solitude,
Clinging like a mushroom upon immensity;
First dream of the world, blooming in the sky,
Or the first blasphemy hanging in its flight
A great astral lily, a cup of light and mist,
A caress or sunburn in the darkness,
An electric and pale witch that guides on paths,
Misleads souls, hypnotizes destinies
Spouse of the world in your magnetic rounds;
Heavenly somnambulist step by step to light;
White or sinister home of lilies or candles,
Medal of purity, pill of delirium;
Talisman of the abyss, strong and melancholic,
Magnetized by life, magnetized by death
Sometimes you seem like grave without a master
And sometimes a cradle, all white! filled with hope and fantasy
In my dreams of love I am a serpent!
I glide and writhe like a stream;
Two capsules of insomnia and hypnosis
Are my eyes; the point of enchantment
Is my tongue and I beckon like a sob!
I am a vial of the abyss.
My body is a ribbon of delight,
It glides and writhes like a caress
And in my dreams of hate I am a serpent!
My tongue is a venomous fount;
My head is a diabolic diadem,
A beam of death, in a sidelong glance
Are my pupils; and my body in gem
Is the sheath of a thunderbolt!
If thus I dream my flesh, my mind is this way;
A long body, long, that of a serpent,
Vibrating eternally, voluptuously!
I, the marble statue with a head of fire,
Cooling my temples in cold and white prayer
In a gesture of palm or of the star
Affix your body, that hypnotic jewel of alabaster
Sculpted with pure kisses and burnished by age;
Serene, like having the moon as a cuirass;
White, more than if you were the foam of race,
And from the tabernacle of your chastity,
Raise to me the deep lilies of your soul;
My shadow will kiss your shroud of calm,
Which rising, rising will enwrap me with you;
Then my flesh will be lost in yours
Then my soul will be diluted in yours
Then there will be glory and we will be a god!
—Love of white and cold,
Love of statues, lilies, stars, gods 
Give him to me, my God!
She has died she has died they say so clearly that I don't understand
To spill so sweet a liquor into so terrible a cup!
Perhaps your divine gaze was a strange illness,
Your heavenly soul, or your delicate profile
Perhaps your arms were two blossoms of wings
The gardens, the rooms, were heaven as you passed
And you appeared to the world sweet, like a dead woman!
Perhaps your window remained open one night,
—Oh, temptation of wings, an open window!—
And through the purest star an angel seduced you
And your wings opened, and cut the height
With a clipping of light and innocence!
And in the chamber that your soul covered with ermine,
Where the vases of roses of tenderness burned,
In silence, loneliness was calling to horror
I was at my divine labor, upon the rock
Swelling with Pride. From a distance,
At dawn, some bright petal came to me,
Some kiss in the night. Upon the rock,
Tenacious a madwoman, I clung to my work.
When your voice, like a sacred bell,
A celestial note with a human tremor,
Stretched its golden lasso from the edge of your mouth;
—Marvelous nest of vertigo, your mouth!
Two rose petals fastened to an abyss...—
Labor, labor of glory, painful and frivolous;
Fabric where my spirit went weaving herself!
You come to the arrogant head of the rock,
And I fall, without end, into the bloody abyss!
Encased in my hands like a strange gem
Your head was shining;
For it I imagined jewel-cases, and light for light,
Shadow for shadow, I esteemed its beauty.
In your eyes perhaps life was gathering
Like a filter of sorrow,
In two deep vases I dreamt
Your head was a marble flower
When, in your forehead whitened by moonlight,
Like a monster in the stillness of a lake,
There emerged an enormous, silent dream
Ah! your head frightened me there flowed
From it a hidden life It resembled
I know not what world anonymous and nocturnal
In your coldness were ensconced
The great Moorish slaves;
Dark and shining in golds
From a distance they guarded me.
And, devouring, they dreamt
In me, I know not what treasures
Behind the crystal of tears
They guarded and threatened.
They beat angelic wings,
They pounded satanic hands,
Their two strange screens;
And when I looked upon them coquettishly,
Their fiery halberds
Pierced my entrails.
It was a vision of fire
With fascinating lights
And beasts of ruby like wounded diamonds;
Rays of blood and fire
Inflamed in gold and purple the whole of my gray eastern sky.
I stood as if blind
What a light! —And then, and then?
Then? The gray eastern sky
Love, the night was tragic and sobbing
When your golden key sang in my lock;
Then, the open door upon the gelid shadow,
Your figure was a stain of light and whiteness.
All was illumined by your diamond eyes;
Your lips of freshness drank in my cup,
And your fragrant head rested on my pillow;
Your impudence fascinated me and I adored your madness.
Today I laugh if you laugh, and I sing if you sing;
And if you sleep I sleep like a dog at your feet!
Today I carry even in my shadow your fragrance of spring;
And I tremble if your hand touches my lock,
And I bless the night sobbing and dark
That in my life your fresh mouth bloomed.
Like a great rising sun it illumined my life
And my soul opened to drink it like a flower of dawn;
Love! Love! Blessed be the redeeming night
In which your florid little hand knocked at my door.
My soul pulsated in the shadow like a jarred harp:
The waters of silence already open, at dawn
It sang with its potent voice, mysterious and sonorous.
My gloomy soul was a sleeping star!
Today all the hope that I lamented as dead,
Emerges to the wingèd life of the bird that awakens
Inebriated with a joy strong as sorrow;
And all things shine and pulsate, everything awakens and sings,
As if the rosy canopy of its holy and living light
Opened upon the world the dawn of my love.
When you spill the gown of snow
Over the pure shoulders of your muse
I gather my dark petals
And I am the lily of light alabaster.
To your muse in rose, I open in rose;
My heart is honey, perfume, and fire;
And I live and die of a glorious thirst:
Your living blood should be water spilled on me.
When covered by a tulle of moonlight
It drinks calm and azure in the lake,
I am the swan that soars, dreaming;
And if in magnificent mourning you dress her
To wander along sad paths,
I am the light or the shadow of a stele
The golden anchor beckons, the blue sail rises
Like the wing of a dream unfolding to a new day.
Let us depart, my muse!
Beyond an anxious prow, the sea stretches itself out.
In the crystal clear East, Aurora's
Blushed beacon shines. Fantasy
Is donning a rare garment of gems
To wander brilliantly over the waves.
The blue sail
Unfolds its private oriflamme to Aeolus...
The supreme moment!...I tremble: do I know—
Oh God!—what awaits me in unseen worlds?
Perhaps a freshly picked bouquet of fragrant laurels,
The golden fleece, a diamond scepter,
A shipwreck, or the eternal crown of the Anointed Ones?...
To Julieta, over the grave of Julio.
The god sleeps in his glory under your protection, Julieta;
A spear of love blushes in your arm;
His berceuse was white, your berceuse is purple 
You were a rose in his bed, you are a lily on his grave.
—The serpents of the world, pointed, spy upon
The suspecting celestial doves in your flesh. —
The god sleeps, Julieta; his pillow is made of stars
Polished by your hand, and your shadow is his robe;
The sleepless watch of your star-gazing
In the night, sole rival of your charm.
—And the beautiful serpents, inflamed, meditate
On the soft doves that sleep upon your body.—
And the god will awake, no one knows what day,
No one dreams in what land of glorification.
If he fell asleep crying, may he smile upon awakening 
In the moon-white vase of your melancholy
Rescue, like a pink diamond, your heart.
And rescue him from everything upon your heart!
In silence I feel time passing,
Like a slow parade, cold and rhythmical...
Ah! When you are far away my whole life cries
And to the murmur of your steps even in dreams I smile.
I know you will return, that another dawn will shine
In my grave horizon like a somber frown;
There in my forest will live again your great sonorous smile
That gaily crossed it like the glass of a river.
One day, meeting sadly on the path,
In your pale hands I placed my destiny!
And no greater thing will anyone ever offer you!
My soul is before your soul like the sea before the sky:
Between them, like the shadow of a flight,
Storm and time, and life, and death will pass!
In my dreams of love I am a serpent!
I glide and writhe like a stream;
Two capsules of insomnia and hypnosis
Are my eyes; the point of enchantment
Is my tongue and I beckon like a sob!
I am a vial of the abyss.
My body is a ribbon of delight,
It glides and writhes like a caress
And in my dreams of hate I am a serpent!
My tongue is a venomous fount;
My head is a diabolic diadem,
A beam of death, in a sidelong glance
Are my pupils; and my body in gem
Is the sheath of a thunderbolt!
If thus I dream my flesh, my mind is this way;
A long body, long, that of a serpent,
Vibrating eternally, voluptuously!
In your chamber covered with reverie, make waste
Of flowers and of spiritual lights; my soul,
Shod in silence and dressed in calm,
Will go after you down the darkest path of this night.
Turn out the lights and behold things beautiful;
Close all doors and enter illusion;
Uproot from mystery a handful of stars
And cover with flowers, like a triumphal vase, your heart.
And you will wait smiling, and you will wait weeping! 
When my soul arrives, perhaps you will pray, thinking
That heaven sweetly spills over your chest...
For divine love sit upon a sofa of calm,
Or with the mystical lily that is its sword, my soul
Will make vanish one by one the roses of your bed!
In your coldness were ensconced
The great Moorish slaves;
Dark and shining in golds
From a distance they guarded me.
And, devouring, they dreamt
In me, I know not what treasures
Behind the crystal of tears
They guarded and threatened.
They beat angelic wings,
They pounded satanic hands,
Their two strange screens;
And when I looked upon them coquettishly,
Their fiery halberds
Pierced my entrails.
Mounted in the night is the lake of your soul,
A cloth, one would say, of crystal and calm
Woven by the large spiders of wakefulness.
A skim of sacred water in alabaster vases;
A mirror of purity that brightens the stars
And reflects the abyss of life in a sky!
I am the wandering swan of the bloody trails,
I go staining the lakes and rising up in flight.
Encased in my hands like a strange gem
Your head was shining;
For it I imagined jewel-cases, and light for light,
Shadow for shadow, I esteemed its beauty.
In your eyes perhaps life was gathering
Like a filter of sorrow,
In two deep vases I dreamt
Your head was a marble flower
When, in your forehead whitened by moonlight,
Like a monster in the stillness of a lake,
There emerged an enormous, silent dream
Ah! your head frightened me there flowed
From it a hidden life It resembled
I know not what world anonymous and nocturnal
There was a chain strong like fate,
Sacred like life, sensitive like a soul;
I cut it with a lily and continue my journey
With the magnificent coldness of death With calm
Curiosity my spirit looks at its inner lake,
And the crystal of the dormant waters,
Reflects a god or a monster, masked in a
Tenebrous sphinx suspended in other lives.
Eros, I want to guide you, blind Father...
From your almighty hands I ask for
His sublime body spilled in fire
Upon my body faint in roses!
The electric corolla that I now open
Offers the nectary of a garden of wives;
To his vultures in my flesh I offer
A whole swarm of roseate doves.
Give to the two cruel serpents of his embrace
My great feverish stem Absinth, honeys,
Spill on me from his veins, from his mouth 
Thus lying I am an ardent furrow
Where can be nurtured the seed
Of another lineage sublimely mad!
It was a vision of fire
With fascinating lights
And beasts of ruby like wounded diamonds;
Rays of blood and fire
Inflamed in gold and purple the whole of my gray eastern sky.
I stood as if blind
What a light! —And then, and then?
Then? The gray eastern sky
She has died she has died they say so clearly that I don't understand
To spill so sweet a liquor into so terrible a cup!
Perhaps your divine gaze was a strange illness,
Your heavenly soul, or your delicate profile
Perhaps your arms were two blossoms of wings
The gardens, the rooms, were heaven as you passed
And you appeared to the world sweet, like a dead woman!
Perhaps your window remained open one night,
—Oh, temptation of wings, an open window!—
And through the purest star an angel seduced you
And your wings opened, and cut the height
With a clipping of light and innocence!
And in the chamber that your soul covered with ermine,
Where the vases of roses of tenderness burned,
In silence, loneliness was calling to horror
A time ago, an already forgotten soul belonged to me
It was nurtured by my shadow Whenever I wished,
The golden fan of its laughter would open,
Or its cry would bleed another current;
A soul that I made flow, like long locks
Spilled upon my hands Flower of fire and wax,
It died from a sadness of mine So flexible it was,
So faithful, that at times I doubt if it ever could have been...
The moon is pallid and sad, the moon is bloodless and cold.
I imagine the half-moon as a profile of the dead...
And beyond the reknowned and praised pallor
Of Arab pearls, I prefer the rose in recent bud.
In a corner of this land with the colors of earth,
I adore this pale moon, I adore this death mask!
And at the altar of the night, like a flower inflamed,
Inebriated by strange perfumes, my soul resigns.
I know of lips withered with blasphemy and wine;
After an orgy they kiss her trace in the lane.
Insane ones who die kissing her image in lakes...
Because she is light of innocence, because white things
Illuminate her mysterious light, things taking on white,
And even the blackest souls become uncertainly bright.
The amazonian little princess, a vibratile filagree,
—Turquoise eyes sculpted of porcelain, little princess—
Called one night at my door with her small hands of iris.
And the trilling crystal of her voice was like an elegant flute:
—I know your life is gray.
I have the soul of a rose, the dew of budding flowers,
I come from a beautiful country
To be your sister and muse!—.
An arm of alabaster...then, in the sonorous carnation
Of her mouth, softest honey; in a cloud of gold and perfume
She surrounded me, brash horsewoman, like a deluge.
Oh honey, freshness, perfumer!...The sudden dream, the shadow
Which intoxicates...and when I wake, the sun that falls on my carpet
In a false ruby very red, and a false ringlet very blond.
—Night's tent has ripped open to the East.—
Your spirit dawns marvelously;
Its light enters my soul as the sun enters a garden
—The full sun. It rains fire. —Your love tempts, it is the cave
Velvety with moss, the stream, the fruit,
The pleasurable fruit fully ripened like honey.
—The Angelus. Your hands are two still wings,
My spirit bends like a branch of lilies,
And my body covers you as subtle as a veil.
—The triumph of the night. From your most beautiful hands,
Flow all the shadows and all the stars,
And my body becomes as deep as the heavens!
Medallion of the night with the image of the day
And wounded by the pearl of melancholy;
Home of the spirits, heart of the azure,
The sadness of a bride in her tower of tulle;
Mask of mystery or solitude,
Clinging like a mushroom upon immensity;
First dream of the world, blooming in the sky,
Or the first blasphemy hanging in its flight
A great astral lily, a cup of light and mist,
A caress or sunburn in the darkness,
An electric and pale witch that guides on paths,
Misleads souls, hypnotizes destinies
Spouse of the world in your magnetic rounds;
Heavenly somnambulist step by step to light;
White or sinister home of lilies or candles,
Medal of purity, pill of delirium;
Talisman of the abyss, strong and melancholic,
Magnetized by life, magnetized by death
Sometimes you seem like grave without a master
And sometimes a cradle, all white! filled with hope and fantasy
Behold it, thus, over the dark foliage
Drawing its sovereign silhouette...
Does it not seem the premature blossom
Of a race which will live tomorrow?
So an unshakable, robust race
Sculpted with strokes on hard marble,
From the vast campaigns of the future
It will rout the human race.
Behold it, thus —crouched— in imperial
Calm, imposing frightful nakedness!
God!... Move that body, give it a soul!
See the greatness that sleeps in its form...
See it up there, wretched, defenseless,
Poorer than a worm, forever calm!
O you who sleep so deep you cannot wake!
Every night in mourning I come upon your pupils,
Miraculous in life, miraculous in death,
And in life and death eternally open.
Beneath a remnant of shade or silk lace of moon,
I drink their calm as I would a lagoon.
For depth, for silence, for goodness, for peacefulness.
Each one seeming a bed or a tomb.
Rare ring that lightens
Rare ring that darkens
A deep amethyst,
A vesperian twilight
That in your matutinal platinum
A splendid artist mounted.
The future is made of fear...
Will your destiny be a finger
Of tempest or of calm?
To lighten you or to darken you,
If I could only slide you
Over one finger of my soul!
If life were love, how blessed it would be!
I want more life so to love! Now I feel
A thousand years of ideas are not worth
One blue minute of sentiment.
My heart was dying slowly, sadly...
Now it opens like a Phoebean flower:
Life rushes forth like a turbulent sea
Whipped by the hand of love.
My sorrow flies into the night, sad, cold
With its broken wings;
Like an old scar that continues to ache—
In the distant shade it dissolves...
All my life sings, kisses, laughs!
All my life is a flowering mouth!
Their Idyll was a long smile with lips fourfold
In the warm bosom of golden Spring
They loved each other so that between their expert fingers
Palpitated the divine form of chimera.
In the radiant palaces of quiet afternoons
They spoke words that fall on the ear like a sob,
And kissed deeply, so that their souls were consumed!
The hours withered and fell like blossoms of gold.
And fate interposed her two icy hands
Ah, their bodies yielded, but their interwoven souls
Are the most intricate knot there ever was
Struggling with their mad and superhuman liaisons
The furies of life wrought so as to break their hands
And Ananke exhausted her supreme fingers
Remember? The stream was the kind serpent
It flowed sadly and sadly like the cry of a blind man,
When in the gray stones where sorrow is rooted,
Like an immense lily, there arose your prayer.
My heart, the grayest and most serene stone,
Awoke in the caress of the stream, and then
It felt like the evening, with hands of a Mohammedan
There hung from it a rose of fire.
And while the serpent of the stream brandished
The divine poison of melancholy,
Touched by the sunset your head overwhelmed me,
I crowned it with a fatal kiss; in the current
I saw a corpse of fire passing by And madly
In your deep embrace, sorrow cast me to the ground.
Your widow life will adorn that day in jewels...
In the wild charm of the village
Your arcane profile was a wound;
Unusual, alarming, it suggested
The enamel of a precious gem
Upon a mountainous breast.
Through the mouth of the open window sighed
All the orchard in bloom, and the sunny room
Was itself all the village;
Remember?... Upon me was projected,
More mortal than your shadow on the wall,
Your solemn sorrow of one gone astray...
Your hands, elongated by grasping toward fate,
All pale by trying to shroud dreams,
Seemed to touch me from a distance...
Your eyes were an infinite path
And new moons grew out below your eyes;
In only one kiss we became old...
—Oh, kiss!... flower of four petals... two of knowledge
And two illumined by innocence
The chalice an abyss, enrapturing and somber.—
By a miracle of melancholy,
Marble or brass I shattered in your hand
Spilling my spirit, like a pomander of essence.
Your widowed life will adorn that day in jewels...
My nostalgia has painted your Wagnerian profile
Upon the tremendous veil of absence.
A divine illusion? A profound memory?
It was a supreme moment at the gates of the world!
Destiny told me marvelously:
—Your temples are two live royal mountings:
Choose a crown, all go to your brow!—
And I saw them spring from the fertile hands,
Blooming and glorious, tragic and brilliant!
Colder than the marmoreal corpse of a statue,
I saw thorns, and flowers, and diamonds rolling,
Like the splendid accessories of an illusory chimera.
Afterwards it was a shining stream of golden stars;
—Take! —it said— they are kisses of miracle, between them
Like two warm lands your temples will bloom!
Like dying pupils, they rolled away and were extinguished
I walked into life, sweetly, dreaming
To sink my fertile temples into your pale hands!
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse,
Come, you who jumbles the deep enigmas
In the shivering of the warm pupils.
Who hollows out the amethyst riverbed
Of lived circles under her eyes 
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
Come, you, the one who imprints a solemn rhythm
Upon the trembling of the glacial tomb;
The one who sets the dismal tone
Of the deep utterance of tragic shadows.
Come, you, weary poet, who plucks
The lyre of silence: the strangest one!
The one of the long mute vibrations,
Who harmonizes with the sound of the soul!
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Come, come closer to me, that in my pupils
Yours may sink in tenacious sight,
That there may glimmer in them the sublime enigma
Of the hereafter, which frightens 
Come come closer to me pierce in my lips
Your cold lips of amber,
May I try in them the unknown taste
Of the enervating essence of your soul!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
Come, listen, I call on you,
Strange lover of my strange muse!
O Muse, let the golden fountain vibrate
The rosy cup of your mouth with kisses;
From the harmonious foams let spring forth
Live, supreme, mysterious, eternal
The ideal lover, the one sculpted
In prodigies of souls and bodies;
He must be alive by force of dreaming,
As blood and soul are taken from me in my dreams;
He must be born to dazzle Life,
And he must be a new god!
The blue serpents of his veins
Are nourished by miracle in my mind
O Muse, let the golden fountain seal
The rosy cup of your mouth with kisses;
The ideal lover, the one sculpted
In prodigies of souls and bodies,
Rooting his superhuman nails
In my flesh, he sobs in my reveries:
—I want no other life than your life,
In you exist the supreme elements;
Leave me under the sky of your soul,
In the warm soil of your body!—
—O Muse, let the golden fountain seal
The rosy cup of your mouth with kisses!
I believed that your eyes were flooding the world
Opened like mouths in clamor So aching
That they seemed a heart broken in two ardent pieces
They were flowing from your enigmatic face
As two springs grave and poisonous
Forges of fire and shadow, your pupils! so deep
That I know not from where they spied me,
Round and obscure like distant and timid worlds.
Ah, your eyes so sad like two galleries
Opened to the west! And the shadowy paths
Of your dark-circled eyes where I traced my path!
I wrapped in a great gesture my horror like in a veil,
And I walked away believing that in the sky there appeared
The moist midnight of your starless gaze!
I was at my divine labor, upon the rock
Swelling with Pride. From a distance,
At dawn, some bright petal came to me,
Some kiss in the night. Upon the rock,
Tenacious a madwoman, I clung to my work.
When your voice, like a sacred bell,
A celestial note with a human tremor,
Stretched its golden lasso from the edge of your mouth;
—Marvelous nest of vertigo, your mouth!
Two rose petals fastened to an abyss...—
Labor, labor of glory, painful and frivolous;
Fabric where my spirit went weaving herself!
You come to the arrogant head of the rock,
And I fall, without end, into the bloody abyss!
I went along, alone, to the mystery beneath a sun of madness,
And you spilled your shadow upon me, pilgrim;
Your glance was kind, like a dark path,
Like a damp path covering the way.
Prodigal and fertile to me was your bag of tenderness:
I had the simplicity of bread, and the flame of wine;
But your soul in a fold of its astral raiment,
A burr of gold and shadow, bore off my destiny.
My hands, which your hands covered, never
Shall grow cold, and holding fast in the sweet close mesh
Of your caress, will never be able to caress!
In my body, a tower of memory and hope
With the feel of marble and the dream of wax,
Your shadow casts roses of fire in the hearth
And in my soul, a castle desolate and sounding
With patinas of tedium and moistness of tears,
Your shadow casts roses of snow in the hearth!
I, the marble statue with a head of fire,
Cooling my temples in cold and white prayer
In a gesture of palm or of the star
Affix your body, that hypnotic jewel of alabaster
Sculpted with pure kisses and burnished by age;
Serene, like having the moon as a cuirass;
White, more than if you were the foam of race,
And from the tabernacle of your chastity,
Raise to me the deep lilies of your soul;
My shadow will kiss your shroud of calm,
Which rising, rising will enwrap me with you;
Then my flesh will be lost in yours
Then my soul will be diluted in yours
Then there will be glory and we will be a god!
—Love of white and cold,
Love of statues, lilies, stars, gods 
Give him to me, my God!
I dreamt it impetuous, formidable, and ardent;
It spoke the imprecise language of the torrent,
It was a sea overflowing with madness and fire,
Rolling through life like an eternal fountain.
Afterwards, I dreamt it sad like a great sun setting
That facing the night turns its fiery head;
Then it laughed, and in its mouth as tender as a prayer
The soul of the fountain sounded its crystal.
And today I dream it vibrant and tender, laughing, and sad,
That it dresses all iris and darkness;
That, fragile like an idol and eternal like God,
Its majesty rises above all life:
And the kiss falls in fire to perfume its soles
In a fiery flower plucked by two
I die strangely... It is not life that kills me
It is not death that kills me, nor is it love;
I die of a thought, mute as a wound...
Have you never felt such a strange pain
Of an immense thought that is rooted in life,
Devouring flesh and soul, and without blooming?
Have you never carried inside a dormant star
That was burning you wholly without shining?
Height of martyrdom!... To eternally bear,
Rending and arid, the tragic seed
Pierced in one's entrails like a ferocious fang!...
But to uproot it one day in a flower that would bloom
Miraculous, inviolable!... Ah, it would not be greater
To hold in one's hands the head of God!
I don't know if my eyes or my hands
Sparked life in your portrait;
Human clouds, superhuman rays,
All your I of innate emperor
Rises to my eyes, in my hands.
For that, all in flames, I unbind
Hair and soul for your portrait,
And I open in bloom!... Then, sovereign,
Of shadow and light, your grave eyes
Say great things that I know and you know
And I let you die In my hands remains
A great stain, livid and somber
And in my melancholy you are born again
Formed by cold and remote stars!
The one I wanted came,
the one I called.
Not the one who sweeps away defenseless skies,
stars without homes,
moons without a country,
snows.
The kind of snows that fall from a hand,
a name,
a dream,
a face.
Not the one who tied death
to his hair.
The one I wanted.
Without scraping air,
without wounding leaves or shaking windowpanes.
The one who tied silence
to his hair.
To scoop out, without hurting me,
a shoreline of sweet light inside my chest
so that my soul could sail.
...And the pans will already be 
Seeping the blue from the sea.
Let me be, salters
A tlittle grain from the salina!
How nice at dawn
To run the wagons,
Full of salty snow
Toward the white houses!
I quit being seaman, mother,
To become salter.
If my voice dies on land,
take it down to the sea
and leave it on the shore.
Take it down to the sea
and make it captain
of a white man-of-war.
Honor it with
a sailors medal:
over its heart an anchor,
and on the anchor a star,
and on the star the wind,
and on the wind a sail!

Haughty, beautiful, embalming the wind
With her nascent scent, she gushed proudly
As the morning sun rises,
And from the auras the fragrant breath.
The nightingales with a loud accent,
As they contemplate beauty so early
They greeted her; and the elegant flower
held out her blades toward the sky.
But the hurricane came. —With an impious hand,
envious when looking at so much beauty,
To the ground he threw it withered grass.
Faithful image of my hope
That found a sad grave in my chest!
So fresh at birth! - so soon dead!...

In Jaen where I'm abiding
Don Lope de Sosa dwells,
And my story, Ines, tells
Wonders past your mind's providing.
On this gentleman attended
A young squire from Portugal
But to supper let us fall
So my hunger may be ended.
For the table is awaiting
Where together we may sup;
Forth are set the steaming cup
And the glass, no more debating,
Cut the bread, ah, what a savor!
This hors d'Åuvre is Paradise!
From the salpicón arise
Odors of a heavenly flavor.
Pour the wine into the glasses
And invoke a blessing now;
Every time I drink I vow
And bless each ruby drop that passes.
That was sure a healthy portion,
Ines, pass the bottle here;
Every mouthful would appear
Worth a florin, no extortion.
In what tavern do you buy it?
From the place by the ravine;
Ten and six a measure, clean,
Fresh and good and cheap to try it.
By the Lord, it is a treasure
That Alcocer tavern wine;
Certainly, I think it's fine
To have at hand so just a measure.
Whether old or new invention,
On my faith, I do not know,
But this I see that here below
The tavern came with good intention.
For 'tis there I go a-thirsting,
Order up the newest brew,
Mixing it they serve to you.
You pay and drink yourself to bursting.
This, my Ines, is its merit,
There's no need to sing its praise
The one objection that I raise,
The fleeting joy that we inherit.
Now, the lighter dishes over,
Tell me what is coming now?
The meat-pie! blessed brow,
Worthy of such noble cover!
What a dish it is, how hollow!
What meat and luscious fat it holds!
It seems, Ines, that it unfolds
Its depths for you and ine to swallow.
But onward, onward, without question,
For straight and narrow is the road;
No more water, let the load
Of wine, Ines, invite digestion.
Pour out the three-year vintage freely,
'Twill aid your stomach in its work.
How good to see you do not shirk
But take a grown man's portion, really!
Now tell me, is it not delightful
To have a dish so fine and rare,
With all its biting flavors there,
And all its spices fresh and spiteful?
Pine-nuts in its luscious dressing
Make the brave dame's meat-pie sweet;
And roasted by her there's a treat
In suckling pig that is a blessing.
As true as heaven 'tis fit to honor
The very table of the King;
A pork, Ines, the sweetest thing
With her delicious tripe upon her!
My very heart is filled with rapture;
I don't know how it is with you,
But taking now and then a view,
You seem contentment here to capture.
Great heavens! I am full of liquor;
But I would make a sage remark;
You brought one lamp to light the dark,
Now two before me seem to flicker.
But these are really drunken notions;
I know of course it had to be,
That with this heavy drink I'd see
The lights increasing with the potions.
Now let us try the tankard's juices,
Celestial beverage refined,
Superior to what we bind
In casks, it livelier joy produces.
What smoothness and what glassy clearness!
What taste and odor ratified!
What touch! What color there beside
And all that makes for luscious dearness!
But now there come the cheese and berry
To take their place upon the board;
And both it seems would claim award
Of cup and tankard passing merry.
Try the cheese, the choice from many,
Quite as good as Pinto 's best;
And the olives for the rest
They can hold their own with any.
Now then, Ines, if you're able
Take six mouthfuls from the flask
There is nothing more to ask;
Clear the covers from the table.
And as we have supped and rested
To our very hearts' content
It would seem the moment meant
For the story I suggested.
'Tis a tale, Ines, to win you
For the Portuguese fell ill
Eleven striking? Wait until
Tomorrow, I'll the tale continue.
I'm going to reveal to you a secret
in a sonnet, Inez, lovely enemy;
but however well I set up this one,
in the first of the quatrains it can't be.
Now that we're in the second, I do promise
that it won't end before the secret's said;
but I'll be, my Inez, a monkey's uncle,
if of this sonnet eight lines haven't fled.
So see, Inez, how fate so harshly treats us;
for with the sonnet ready on my lips,
and having all its intricacies spun,
I've counted all the lines and now discover,
that, following the sonnet's normal count,
this sonnet, Inez, is already done.
Clear fount of light! my native land on high,
Bright with a glory that shall never fade!
Mansion of truth! without a veil or shade,
Thy holy quiet meets the spirit's eye.
There dwells the soul in its ethereal essence,
Gasping no longer for life's feeble breath;
But, sentinelled in heaven, its glorious presence
With pitying eye beholds, yet fears not, death.
Beloved country! banished from thy shore,
A stranger in this prison-house of clay,
The exiled spirit weeps and sighs for thee!
Heavenward the bright perfections I adore
Direct, and the sure promise cheers the way,
That, whither love aspires, there shall my dwelling be.
"What is the cause, my Damon, that as we
together in love's tussle are combined
with tongues and arms and feet, and all enchained
like grapevines that in jasmine get entwined,
and, taking both of us the breath of life
in through our lips, worn out from sips sublime,
amidst such joy we find ourselves compelled
to groan and sigh out loud from time to time?"
"Love, my Phyllis fair, who deep inside
our souls did bind, within his forge aspires
our bodies to conjoin with force as great,
and since it can't —like water with a sponge—
pass into the beloved soul's sweet core,
the mortal veil bemoans its shabby fate."
A thousand times I say, in Galatea's
arms, that she's more lovely than the sun;
then she, with a sweet look, disdainfully,
tells me, "My Tyrsis, do not tell me that."
I try to swear it, and she, suddenly,
her face now blazing with a rosy hue
restrains me with a kiss and hastily
my words with her own lips seeks to combat.
I struggle with her mildly to break free,
and she holds me more tightly and then says,
"Don't swear, my love, I know it's not a lie."
With this she so completely shackles me
that Love, a witness to our gentle play,
causes with deeds my hope to satisfy.
O Lord! who seest, from yon starry height,
Centred in one the future and the past,
Fashioned in thine own image, see how fast
The world obscures in me what once was bright!
Eternal Sun! the warmth which thou hast given,
To cheer life's flowery April, fast decays;
Yet in the hoary winter of my days,
Forever green shall be my trust in Heaven.
Celestial King! O let thy presence pass
Before my spirit, and an image fair
Shall meet that look of mercy from on high,
As the reflected image in a glass
Doth meet the look of him who seeks it there,
And owes its being to the gazer's eye.

But it is sadder than that, much, much sadder.
Sad as a branch letting its fruit fall for no one.
Sadder, much sadder.  Like the mist
the dead fruit breathes out from the ground.
Like that hand that rises from the corpse lying in state
and merely wants to touch the lamps,
the grieving smile, the night speechless and velvet.
Luminous night above the corpse stretched out without its soul.
The soul outside, soul outside the body, swooping
with such delicacy over the shape sad and abandoned.
Soul of soft mist, held floating
above its former lover, the defenseless and pale
body, which grows colder as the night goes on,
it remains silent, alone, empty in a gentle way.
Soul of love that watches and hesitates
to free itself, but finally leaves, gentle and cold.

The Farmer Pig orders
Shoot all the birds!
And he loses his cop cats...
all through the wheat fields.
A short while after, they bring
a frightened little bird...
whose beak still holds a grain...
of wheat it hasn't yet swallowed.
You'll die, thief!
But I'm an honest bird...
a woodpecker by trade...
and I work for my living!
So why are you stealing my wheat?
I take it as the wages,
you still haven't paid,
and you owe me so many grains!
Just like you owe
the gardener toads,
and my friend the ovenbird,
and the miner beetle,
and the workers bees,
and everyone you've cheated.
You have made your riches
stealing from the proletariat!
You're dangerous! A socialist!
Shoot him this instant!
Ready, aim... fire!
Damn, even the birds
in Latinamerica
become revolutionaries!

He who passed over the mountains
And did not want to serve on the plain—
Is he the one, when war was returned,
Who's now bragging?
Since he vacillates so much now,
Let him be damned!
He who doled out his money
Without attracting any good knights—
Is it because he wasn't first in the fight
That he's bragging now?
Since he came at us with his rear,
Let him be damned!
He who raised a great soldiery
But never quite a good cavalry,
Since he didn't go to Granada, is he
The one who's bragging?
Whether he's rich or has a strong band,
Let him be damned!
He who loaded up his bags
With a little gold and a lot of guff,
And never quite entered the town of Vega,
Is he bragging now?
Since he's more like fat than butter,
Let him be damned!

I am tired.
Â  See
this city
—any city you like—
where I have twenty years lived.
Â  Everything the same.
A child
pointlessly counts the stars
on the neighbouring balcony.
I start as well...
But he goes faster: I cannot
catch him:
Â  One, two, three four,
five...
Â  I cannot
catch him: One, two...
three...
four...
Â  five...

If I can no longer see myself,
if only my roots survive,
if birds look in vain 
for where their nests were
amid the sad absence of my arms,
do not cry for this.
In a Spring silence,
verdant shoots of life will emerge
from the earth like tears.
I will be that horde of adolescents,
that laurel wreath that encircles
the trunk sundered by the axe.
Life multiplied brings death.
Multiple are the rays of dawn.
I forget to live if I remember you, 
I recognize that I am dust of the earth 
and I incorporate you, as does 
that part closest to your grave, 
insensitive land that usurps
the zealous love of your friends.
With your life over, its outline 
is forever fully drawn: 
theres no door to take you into the future.
The tree of your name has blossomed 
into an incalculable Spring. 
Death is perfection, a rounding off. 
Only the dead can be named.
We who live are nameless.
The mythical makers of fame catapult
the chants of your name world-wide 
and lifes lake opens its eyes 
with endless eyelids of glass: 
There is no mountain, no sky, no plain, 
that does not concentrically enhance 
the echo of your illustrious name.
Its not a brothers grief, not human pain, 
my suffering is part of the sentiment 
that turns the pensive stars into flowers
embroidered on the night that shrouds you. 
I write these words separately
from the daily pattern of my sleep, 
from a distant planet where I suffer
your irreparable loss in tears.
Today to me my body seems
a recollection of me.
Its not my memory
that lives in my forehead,
but my whole body
which is huddled
within it, among the clouds,
waiting for the death of oblivion.
Im now more than me.
I shaped my surroundings,
wrapped my soul around me,
abandoned the life of men.
I want to forget my body,
would like it to sleep within me.
Its external dreams
will flood my spirit.
Foreign populations,
new gods,
different elements,
surround it.
Im dictating words
to the one I was in the world,
who believes he detains me
under his watchful eye,
the one Im bossing about,
overshadowing,
the one who writes this story.

My small

They're so cute,
so little,
so silky,
so finite,

They chirp, run,
poke, jump,
they seek, they shout,
they come, they go,
they fight
like crazies
for a piece
of bread.

I am not moved to love Thee, O my Lord,
By any longing for Thy Promised Land;
Nor by the fear of hell am I unmanned
To cease from my transgressing deed or word.
Tis Thou Thyself dost move me,—Thy blood poured
Upon the cross from nailed foot and hand;
And all the wounds that did Thy body brand;
And all Thy shame and bitter death's award. 
Yea, to Thy heart am I so deeply stirred
That I would love Thee were no heaven on high,—
That I would fear, were hell a tale absurd!
Such my desire, all questioning grows vain;
Though hope deny me hope I still should sigh,
And as ray love is now, it should remain.

Three dark maids,—I loved them when
In Jaën,—
Axa, Fátima, Marien.
Three dark maids who went together
Picking olives in clear weather,
My, but they were in fine feather
In Jaën,—
Axa, Fátima, Marien.—
There the harvests they collected,
Turning home with hearts dejected,
Haggard where the sun reflected
In Jaën,—
Axa, Fátima, Marien.—
Three dark Moors so lovely they—
Three dark Moors so lovely, they
Plucked the apples on that day
Near Jaën,—
Axa, Fátima, Marien.
Unhappy who seeks in appearance
bliss and ephemeral praise,
and changes his mind with the change
of the versatile public conscience!
The present is your only providence;
yields to the blowing of the wind that throws him
to good without faith and evil without hope;
that in erring with the world is his science.
And happy the independent male
who, free from worldly bondage,
aspires, between pain and sorrow,
to the eternal truth, not to the present one,
knowing that the world and its truths
they are only vanity of vanities!

I wish to make my sermon brief,—to shorten my oration,—
For a never-ending sermon is my utter detestation;
I like short women,—suits at law without procrastination,—
And am always most delighted with things of short duration.
A babbler is a laughing-stock; he's a fool who's always grinning
But little women love so much, one falls in love with sinning.
There are women who are very tall, and yet not worth the winning,
And in the change of short for long repentance finds beginning.
To praise the little women Love besought me in my musing;
To tell their nobler qualities is quite beyond refusing;
So I'll praise the little women, and you'll find the thing amusing
They are, I know, as cold as snow, whilst flames around diffusing.
They're cold without, whilst warm within the flame of Love is raging,
They're gay and pleasant in the street,—soft, cheerful, and engaging,
They're thrifty and discreet at home,—the cares of life assuaging;
All this and more;—try and you'll find how true is my presaging.
In a little precious stone what splendor meets the eyes!
In a little lump of sugar how much of sweetness lies!
So in a little woman love grows and multiplies;
You recollect the proberb says,—"A word unto the Wise."
A pepper-corn is very small, but seasons every dinner
More than all other condiments, although 'tis sprinkled thinner;
Just so a little woman is, if Love will let you win her,—
There's not a joy in all the world you will not find within her.
And as within the little rose you find the richest dyes,
And in a little grain of gold much price and values lies,
As from a little balsam much odor doth arise,
So in a little woman there's a taste of paradise.
Even as a little ruby its secret worth betrays,
Color and price and virtue, in the clearness of its rays,—
Just so a little woman much excellence displays,
Beauty and grace and love and fidelity always.
The skylark and the nightingale, though small and light of wing
Yet warble sweeter in the grove than all the birds that sing;
And so a little woman, though a very little thing,
Is sweeter far than sugar and flowers that bloom in spring.
The magpie and the golden thrush have many a thrilling note,
Each as a gay musician doth strain his little throat
A merry little songster in his green and yellow coat;
And such a little woman is, when Love doth make her dote.
There's nought can be compared to her, throughout the wide creation;
She is a paradise on earth,—our greatest consolation,—
So cheerful, gay and happy, so free from all vexation;
In fine, she's better in the proof than in anticipation.
If as her size increases are woman's charms decreased,
Then surely it is good to be from all the great released.
Now of two evils choose the less—said a wise man of the East,
By consequence, of woman-kind be sure to choose the least.
I wish to make my sermon brief,—to shorten my oration,—
For a never-ending sermon is my utter detestation;
I like short women,—suits at law without procrastination,—
And am always most delighted with things of short duration.
A babbler is a laughing-stock; he's a fool who's always grinning
But little women love so much, one falls in love with sinning.
There are women who are very tall, and yet not worth the winning,
And in the change of short for long repentance finds beginning.
To praise the little women Love besought me in my musing;
To tell their nobler qualities is quite beyond refusing;
So I'll praise the little women, and you'll find the thing amusing
They are, I know, as cold as snow, whilst flames around diffusing.
They're cold without, whilst warm within the flame of Love is raging,
They're gay and pleasant in the street,—soft, cheerful, and engaging,

Sudden I saw the ruddy sun to turn
In cloudy trouble and to disappear;
Across his hidden face the lightning drear
Upon the darkness then began to burn.
Full soon the furious south-wind came to churn
In fury and tormenting far and near;
And where the shoulders of great Atlas rear,
Olympus shook beneath the thunder stern.
But soon the heavy veil is swept away
By rains, and clear again the morning shines
With gladness full-renewed across the skies;
Marking the freshened splendors of the day,
I murmur—These perchance may be the signs
Wherein the image of my fortune lies.

Gray whale,
once there is no more left of you than an image
of the dark shape that moved on the waters
in animal paradise,
once there is no memory,
no legend to log your life and its passage
because there is no sea where your death will fit
I want to set these few words
on your watery grave:
"Gray whale,
show us the way to another fate".
It rains in the night
on the old roofs and the wet streets
on the black hills
and on the temples in the dead cities
In the dark I hear the ancestral music of the rain
its ancient footfall      its dissolving voice
More rapid than the dreams of men
the rain makes roads through the air
makes trails through the dust
longer than the footstep of men.
Tomorrow we will die
die twice over
Once as individuals
a second time as a species
and between the bolts of lightning and the white seeds
scattered through the shadows
theres time for a complete examination of conscience
time to tell the human story
It rains
It will rain in the night
but on the wet streets and black hills
there will be no one to hear rain fall
So then an angel is the one
who comes with us,
stepping into our shadow
and turns up when we are
on the brink of kissing a bitter mouth;
the one who, at times, doesnt show
but leaves us in the face of death alone
in an abyss much greater than ourselves.
So then, an angel is
our spiritual bodyguard
who protects us from our material enemies,
supernatural ones and those
we ourselves engender
out of dreams, images and words,
it is the one who wrestles at midnight,
in the middle of the bed, and half-way down the street,
against these hateful fi gures
and fi gures that we love.
An angel has passed by, people say,
when a hush falls between us,
joined apparently into one body:
while these angels of ours take their rest,
examine themselves in the mirror
or gaze through the window
at the long yellow afternoon.
An angel went by, say the lovers,
as though the longed for presence
its absence had a body in,
as if after it was gone, they had picked up its footstep
and knew they loved, after they loved no longer.
An angel went by, says an angel,
without seeing its own shadow in the moment,
unperceiving of the longing
its words leave behind in us:
people of fl esh and bone,
drunk on love and death,
watching it from the other side of the window
Shes an angel, they say of her:
the grace of whose body
is beyond measure,
the light in whose eyes we cannot gauge
nor the width of whose smile, calculate,
even less, weigh
the footprint left behind where she walks
I have an angel, says the person dying,
searching around him for a companion
to guide him through his private abysses.
I have an angel, he says when he dies,
visible at last, the one who guarded over me in life.
I have an angel, I will say when I lift up
my being into its being,
as though we had walked
together from forever.
He has his angel, another angel will say,
watching at the window
how we are lost to sight
in the yellow afternoon
Oh, sunflower seer,
oh, yellow seed,
your name fits in a single syllable, said the poet
Oh, father of mythologies,
the dream of light produces shapes,
said the painter
If the eye were not solar,
how would it be able to see the light,
said the poet
If the light were not a master of color,
how would it be able to paint her eyes,
said the painter
The Sun rises on the Great Pyramid of Giza every day,
night sets in the Orient of your eyes every morning,
said the poet
The Sun doesn't set on the horizon,
the Sun knows no night,
what darkens is the eye, said the painter
I don't need to go into afternoon fields
to see the glories of the Sun for the Sun
of mythologies is the eye, said the poet
The Sun's poem is infinite,
we can only paint it in words,
said the painter
Whenever the Sun speaks,
every creature goes quiet,
said the poet
The Sun is a Being,
the Sun is light present,
said the painter
Light's infinite smile
is a verse that is a poem
that is a universe,
the thinking eye is a laughing eye,
the eye that thinks us we paint
with its own rays, said the poet
The Sun has no history,
the Sun lives in the eternity of the moment,
said the painter
The stripe-faced Sun is a jaguar
running through the night sky devouring shadows,
devouring instants, said the poet
The Sun erstwhile. A deified Sun.
The Sun in the mind. A demented Sun,
said the painter
Light's history
is an archaeology of eyes,
said the poet
Intelligent light comes from the Sun
at the right temperature to paint your hands,
said the painter
The figure projecting shadow, the insubstantial
silhouette following you down the street, that's me,
said the poet
What is a shadow,
a splendor on one's back
and a blot on the ground, said the painter
The Sun is the shape of its love,
man bears in his eyes the shape of that love,
at life's end man will be the specter of that love
At the end of the day, amid the long evening shadows,
man will miss his past splendor,
said the painter
God doesn't exist, said a third party,
God lives inside your head.
If you don't think of Him, He dies, out of mind
If God doesn't exist, who does?
Your shadow? your ghost? your un-memory?
replied the painter
God doesn't exist,
a gigantic vacuum exists,
said the third party
If a gigantic vacuum exists,
something does exist then,
said the poet
Those are
nothing but words,
said the third party
If God didn't exist,
neither would your words,
said the poet
Before dawn, my eyes
had already devised the creatures you see
at this moment under the Sun, said the painter
Everything began with an image,
everything began with the word light,
said the poet
When dogs bark at the Moon,
they're actually barking at the Sun,
said the painter
The expanding universe fits into our minds,
into our expanding minds fit all the stars,
our mind is a verse towards the universe, said the poet
I was struck by my own old age
the moment I saw the first gray hair on my daughter's head,
said the painter
Man's task:
to not be sad under the light,
said the poet
The encyclopedia of the Sun is my bedside book.
The Sun's encyclopedia is an eye blazing
through the closed covers, said the painter
In the corners of my library,
hidden amid thousands of words,
shines the poem of the Sun, said the poet
It's odd I should never before
have drawn such dazzling figures
with rays of faint light, said the painter
Isn't it odd that the poem of the Sun
arrives with the eyes closed and at night?
said the poet
The volatile nature of human beings,
the giving nature of things in this world
we owe to the Sun, said the painter
From seeing it so much my eyes have grown solar,
from so much naming of it my words glow,
said the poet
From painting its eyes so much I have been rendered blind,
its images sear my fingers,
said the painter
The Sun's portrait,
others will put the finish to,
said the poet
The poem of the Sun
began a long time ago,
said the poet
Oh, sunflower seer,
oh, yellow syllable,
said the poet
To Cloé an to Eva Sofía
And God said: Let an angel be made.
And the angel was made out of words.
And man said: Let the angel be made
out of the words within.
Let the angel be in the likeness of my spirit.
And God said: Each man shall have
an angel in heaven
in his own image and likeness,
and when he dies, let him be one with it.
And man said: If God will not create an angel,
the imagination should,
for if there is a void between God and I,
there can be no communicating between us.
It is mete that a spirit
intermediary exist
between heaven and earth,
between the visible and the invisible,
between matter and the spirit.
God said: Man is come late
for the time of gods
and early to be a being;
the angel arrived in time
for the two.
Man said: Then,
an angel is a body
which joins a being to the gods,
a bridge uniting
the look with what is looked at.
God said: So that angels and men
may understand each other,
let the angels on earth
speak in the language of men
and men when they dream
speak in the language of angels
because there is an original tongue
which angels of all ages and all races
understand,
which is composed of poetry.
Man said: Then, an angel knows
when it stands before another angel,
not by what they display or say,
but by the light coming from their eyes.
Said God: Angels cannot be seen
by the eye for they are in our eyes.
Said man: Then, the angel
we search the world for
is us and within us.
God said: Once he has met up
with himself a man may be the angel
he has sought throughout the world.
For the bodies of the two are wrought
out of the words within.
Man said: The angel I do not see,
who goes with me, but does not see me,
is what I shall be when I die.
God said: Let the angel of man
have a life far beyond him,
let it rise out of his corpse
and come into his true existence.
Let the angel have whatever form
man wishes it.
Said man: Then, the body
of an angel is what
the imagination makes of it,
the angel painted on my back,
the angel tattooed on my arms
will cover my back
and stand guard on my arms.
One day it will be the likeness of myself.
And God said: Let the angel
in this time of darkness that is coming
be a messenger of light.
Let the angel be the equal of man.
For this is a time of angels.
So then an angel is the one
who comes with us,
stepping into our shadow
and turns up when we are
on the brink of kissing a bitter mouth;
the one who, at times, doesnt show
but leaves us in the face of death alone
in an abyss much greater than ourselves.
So then, an angel is
our spiritual bodyguard
who protects us from our material enemies,
supernatural ones and those
we ourselves engender
out of dreams, images and words,
it is the one who wrestles at midnight,
in the middle of the bed, and half-way down the street,
against these hateful fi gures
and fi gures that we love.
Goethe said architecture
is frozen music,
but I believe it to be petrified music
and cities, symphonies built out of time,
concerts of visible forgetting.
Of sounds and silences wrought
into iron, wood and air, he said nothing,
perhaps he spoke about the places of verb
where we live, and that way alluded
to us language factories.
Musical streets didnt concern him either,
although man slips via these walkable rivers
into old age, love, the night,
up to the table, into bed,
like a sonata of flesh and bone.
It rains in the night
on the old roofs and the wet streets
on the black hills
and on the temples in the dead cities
In the dark I hear the ancestral music of the rain
its ancient footfall      its dissolving voice
More rapid than the dreams of men
the rain makes roads through the air
makes trails through the dust
longer than the footstep of men.
Tomorrow we will die
die twice over
Once as individuals
a second time as a species
and between the bolts of lightning and the white seeds
scattered through the shadows
theres time for a complete examination of conscience
time to tell the human story
It rains
It will rain in the night

Above thy azure pupil, drooping low,
Thy languid eyelid, falling drowsily,
Is like the pure and candid, driven snow
Upon the violets heaped high.
I ne'er have slept a sleep from sorrow free:
Be happier than I.
Thy voice, when lifted up in maiden prayer,
Is like the black-bird's song on India's shore,
Which, perched on some pagoda fair,
Sings vesper carols, soft as any sigh.
This prayer I send to heaven—nothing more:
Be happier than I.
Thy breath is like the lily's fragrant scent
Upon the banks of Arno's storied flood,
Such flowers as bloom among the rushes, bent
Low by the gentle zephyr wafting by.
I sense it not—nor any earthly good:
Be happier than I.
Love is a spirit formed of fiery air,
Who takes his guidance from the silent night,
And feeds alike on mortal's tears and prayer.
Hidden, thy crimson lips he hovers nigh.
Let him grant thee the bliss and me the blight:
Be happier than I.
Fair are thy lovely, youthful, dawning hours
As field of roses in the Orient.
I begged an angel for a gift of flowers;
He gave them me thy brow to beautify.
I said the while the wreathed crown I bent:
Be happier than I.
Thy tender gaze suggests the turtledove.
Like poppy of the desert wilderness,
Thou causest ecstasy of frantic love,
Sweet houri fallen from a topaz sky.
My fate is hard, and bitter my distress: 
Be happier than I.

it happens like this
the rain
a calm counting of syllables begins
in the pretty clearings of the forest
where the sun plays and mingles
the slow syllables and then
lets out the same old tune
thus begin those immemorial rains
of a complaining voice
that speak of primitive ages
and lull generations
and continue narrating catastrophes
and glories
and powerful germinations
cataclysms
floods
sinkings of towns and races
of cities
rains that come from the depths of the millenia
with their insidious songs
their germinal word that bewitches and captivates
and their flowing countless bars
that can be prisons
or harps
or lyres
but suddenly
they become smiling and slender
they dance
they populate the earth with big leaves
luxurious
with flowers
and with a slight and tender happiness
with humid words
salivated words
they talk to us about wonderful countries
and of the rivers that come down from the sky
we forget their dirge
and we love them then because they are docile
and they help us
and they fertilize the wide earth
the black
and green
and golden earth
it happens like this
the rain
a calm counting of syllables begins
in the pretty clearings of the forest
where the sun plays and mingles
the slow syllables and then
lets out the same old tune
thus begin those immemorial rains
of a complaining voice
that speak of primitive ages
and lull generations
and continue narrating catastrophes
and glories
and powerful germinations
cataclysms
floods
sinkings of towns and races
of cities
rains that come from the depths of the millenia
with their insidious songs
their germinal word that bewitches and captivates
and their flowing countless bars
that can be prisons
or harps
or lyres
but suddenly
they become smiling and slender
they dance
they populate the earth with big leaves
luxurious
with flowers
and with a slight and tender happiness
with humid words
salivated words
they talk to us about wonderful countries
and of the rivers that come down from the sky
we forget their dirge
and we love them then because they are docile
and they help us
and they fertilize the wide earth
the black
and green
and golden earth
The Indians come down from Mixco
laden with deep blue
and the city with its frightened
streets receives them
with a handful of lights
that, like stars, are extinguished
when daybreak comes.
A sound of heartbeats
is in their hands that stroke
the wind like two oars;
and from their feet fall
prints like little soles
in the dust of the road.
The stars that peep out
at Mixco stay in Mixco
because the Indians catch them
for baskets that they fill
with chickens and the big white flowers
of the golden Spanish bayonet.
The life of the Indians
is quieter than ours,
and when they come down from Mixco
they make no sound but the panting
that sometimes hisses on their lips
like a silken serpent.
That I cant bear this much;
on my last illusions behalf.
Ive been ill and pallid
That Ive lost track even
and at the journeys end,
My mothers forms
And the mornings sun
the homes doors opened wide¦
In likewise manner wouldve been!
That was my hope¦
my flowers essence;
The poets lyre,
spaces and the world are deserts¦
were not at the end, were just two corpses
like a swans wing in a lagoon;
hasnt yet peeked beneath the veil
beneath a kiss and at that dawns light;
Lets close it at once
well leave these spaces and return
Lets leave these spaces or if you
Lets throw ourselves off this world then,
well make a moon from memory
well fly if you like,
well smash the tomb and rising
  See
  Everything the same.
  One, two, three four,
  I cannot
  five...

ambassadors

This custom, once lost, was brought back
By a certain Italian Berni,
Whence it became an upstart in Spain.
It was received by the Andalusian and
Castilian vandals with applause and pomp,
And many even treated it as a brother.
It teaches some to sound the beak
Of the poisonous bird that
in order to bite, gives up its life.
It teaches others to sing in counterpoint,
And to enjoy an evil belch so much
That they are almost transformed into another one.
When I look at the sorrows
of your strong martyrdom,
My love, I moan and sigh...
as a last remedy for death.
I try to lose you,
lose with you the annoying life 
and, seeing her for you more than lost,
of the great pleasure that I feel,
I live again... and my torment grows.
Man is a vain, variable and fluttering thing...MONTAIGNE
There are days when were so variable, so variable,
As the light blade of grass to the wind and chance.
Maybe glory smile to under other skies heavens,
For life is clear, billowy and open like the ocean.
And there are days when were so fertile, so fertile,
Like the fields in April, trembling with passion:
Under the generous influence of spiritual rains
The soul sending out bowers of illusion.
And there are days when were so placid, so placid...
—Childhood at sunset, sapphire lagoons!—
That a verse, a trill, a hill, a passing bird,
And even ones own sorrows make us smile.
And there are days when were so sordid, so sordid,
Like the obscure entrails of obscure flint:
Night surprises us with its profuse lamps,
Measuring out Good and Evil with sparkling coins.
And there are days when were so wanton, so wanton
That women offer us their flesh in vain:
After girdling a waist and caressing a breast,
The roundness of a fruit makes us tremble again.
And there are days when were so gloomy, so gloomy,
Like in a gloomy night the crying of a pine grove.
The soul moans then with the pain of the world:
Perchance not even God himself can give us solace.
But there is also, oh Earth, a day... a day... a day
When we weigh anchor never to return...
A day when ineluctable winds blow by,
A day when no one can retain us any longer!
The sound of the wind in the arcade
holds within it the key to myself:
I am a strengthened puissance,
I am a lamentation of the abyss.
In the midst of the sidereal choirs
I hear a thing in me thats out of tune.
My actions and my songs
had a very particular rhythm.
I came to the torrent of life
in Santa Rosa de Osos,
in a midnight all in fire
in luminaries of blurry omens.
I took possession of the earth,
mine in dreams, linen and bread;
and, changing the rules of war
I was Eve and I was Adam.
I embraced the ripe field
as if it were a woman,
and a dark wine of pleasure
muddled me.
I relished the voice of the wind
as if it were a ripe fruit,
and I ate it with a plaint
of greediness in my heart.
And in the day winged skiff
and to the beat of the sea at night
my fantasy drifted
in a beam of solar light.
I went after the supreme form,
after the cloud and the nightingale
and the crystal, the youth and the gem
of heartache.
I went to the Orient, the Orient,
towards the islands of light,
where an ardent people raised
sublime hymns to the blue.
Crossing then Palestine
I saw the face of Benjamin,
his fine mouth, his limpid eye
and his crimson rapture.
Or in Greece in the golden day,
when Pan gave it the pipe,
Socrates loved in the sonorous
choir that sings of joy.
Or with the zeal and the ardor of the dove
in rut, in the Araby of Allah
I followed the course of Mahomet
for the beauty of Abdallah.
Abdallah was something more beautiful
than laurel and lyre and flute and honey;
when a maiden was taken to him,
a hundred maidens died for him!
My hands gathered in the boundaries
to measure the immensity,
but my heart looked elsewhere
for the light, for love, for truth.
My feet dug in the ground
like the very hoof of Lucifer,
and something in me wanted to fly
through the mist, towards the rose of dawn.
But the mysterious lady
of the splendorous hair
comes and lays her hand
and instills in me a fatal love.
And all other things in life
are nothing but that fatal love,
with a few lamps lit
before the altar of the ideal.
And to wander, wander alone,
the light of Saturn on my brow,
broken topmast on the waves,
swaying.
And a glory in my choleric soul
that defies the frowning destiny:
the pride of being  oh America! 
the Ashaverus of your poetry
And in the fleeting flower of the moment
searching for the lost aroma,
and in a pleasure without thoughts
discovering the key of oblivion.
Afterwards a wind a wind a wind
and in that wind, my lamentation!
Do say when I die... (and may the day be far)
That haughty and disdainful, prodigal and turbulent,
In the insatiable vital ecstasy
He was a flame in the wind...
He wandered, sensual and sad, in the islands of his America;
In a pine grove of Honduras he strengthened his breath,
The Mexican land gave him his rebelliousness,
His freedom, his strength... And he was a flame in the wind...
From unfathomed depths he went up to the stars,
In his accent an unknown pain vibrated.
He was wise in his abysses —and humble, humble, humble—
Because he is nothing but a little flame to the wind.
And he knew of lugubrious things, so deep and lethal,
That human lyre could never clarify,
And no one has understood his tragic lament...
He was a flame in the wind and the wind put it out.
A blue mount, a wandering bird,
an oak tree, a prairie,
a boy, a song... And, all the same,
my brother, we know nothing now.
Blotted out the paths in the shadows,
the heart of the mount is closed down;
the shepherds dog tragically howls
amidst the grass of the sheepfold.
Rest your fatigue on my fatigue
that I may rest my sorrow on your sorrow,
and cry, like me, for the influence
of the evening, translucent and serene.
We will always know nothing...
Who put in our yearning soul,
this vague rumor of foundering seas,
this unbound emotion,
these vain chimeras, this useless ?
In this constant uneasiness, my brother,
we will always know nothing...
In which islands of mysterious caves
did the numens lull you to sleep?
Who gave me the unreal fuel
of my ardent passion, and the resin
that effuses its fragrance in my poems?
What divine anxiety, what soft voice
has in our anxiety its resonance?
All inquiries fail in the void
as the nocturnal fireballs foundered
at the bottom of the sea; all questions
return to us, tremulous and frail
the moment the arrow thrown by the bow
hits against the rough escarpment.
In the rambling impulse, my brother,
And yet...
What mystical influence
pours into our pains a radiant balm?
Who hangs from our shoulders
a royal mantle of glorious purple,
and who comes to our wounds
and anoints them and turns them into roses?
You, who lying on the grass
facing the sky, suddenly say:
The evening star is lighted
Avid, my eyes look for its brightness
through the mist, and we ascend
by the thread of light...
A cricket sings
in the regrown moss of the stone hedge
and a conflagration of stars rises
in your breast, calmly facing the evening,
and in my breast, in the evening, appeased...
I did not know that the blue of tomorrow
is a vague specter of the haze of yesterday;
that shaken by gusts of centuries
the heart longs to burn, to burn.
I feel its influence, its latency, and the moment
in which it wants to light its altar candles.
But life is calling
and its too late to learn.
I knew that your sun, tenderness,
gives the childrens sky a rosy hue,
and that under the laurel, the coarse hero
must have something of the child.
Ah, who could be reborn from tremulous
childhood into a dawn of innocence!
But life is passing
I knew that the deep peace
of affection, the lilies of pleasure,
the magnolia of light of energy,
woman carries in her soft breast.
How much a true man I would like to be,
my temples submissive to that soft breast!
But life is running out
Oh, Night
My curse is to go gropingly with my fiery soul,
blind without a guide under the blue of January;
my sorrow, to wander alone along the way;
and the worst of my injuries, not understanding life.
My curse is to go blindly and alone with my history,
to find me here feeling the torturing light,
and that this heart is a transitory ember
burning in the pure night.
And to come unknowing, perhaps from some orient
that the soul in its blindness saw as a mirage,
and longing for the summer gilt by the refulgent sun
to go with fatal steps towards the fatal abyss.
Still, it would perhaps have a noble endeavor
to exalt my spirit under the burning vesper
like a holy perfume
But if the heart is transitory ember!
I feel something like a perennial ardor, nevertheless,
which in the sterile battle my youth sacrifices
(Oh night of the way, vast and sole,
between death and love!)
Paint a young man, with loyal and pure
words, with words of reveries and emotion;
and give to the strophe the rhythm of a cordial tone,
to the rhyme, the variable charm of illusion.
Outline his figure out against the blue
of the sky, in the flowery, smiling prime:
let the sun bathe it leaving it burnished
and his eyes sparkling with a burning flame.
Let a restrained yearning make his flesh tremble,
and the torso, the brow, the sinewy arms,
and the candid look and the blind hope,
compound the splendorous mystery of life!
Swings with children at sunset.
The sky moves away and brings the swing closer.
Branch of the swing nervous and jovial.
Children shake fruitfully.
The strings touch the final blue.
The children return from the vastness.
There is a tense air, hills without walking,
standing trees, unchanged water.
Children lend him their childlike strength,
and the whole landscape comes to life.
Air, hills, trees, unchanged water,
thanks to the swing they start dancing.
All that still seemed to be
inside me it plays like a juggle.
And without moving I let myself be rocked,
On this sunset swing.
TIRSI     —How I should love thee, Cloris, but...
CLORIS                                             —But why?
TlRCIS     —And wouldst thou have me tell thee?
CLORIS                                               —And why not?
TlRCIS     —It might annoy thee.
CLORIS                                   What, annoyed! Not I!
TlRCIS     Then I shall tell thee.
CLORIS                                         —Quick reveal the plot!.
TlRCIS     —Fain would I love thee, Cloris, but I knew...
CLORIS   —I What knewst thou, Tircis?
TlRCIS                                       —That on Sunday last
Thou didst vow to love another lad that passed
And never change.
CLORIS     —My vows I will renew!
Because I have you and I dont
because I think about you
because the night is wide-eyed
because the night passes and I say love
because you have come to reclaim your image
and you are better than all your images
because you are beautiful from foot to soul
because you are good from soul to me
because you hide yourself sweet in pride
small and sweet
armored heart
because you are mine
because you arent mine
because I look at you and die
and worse than dying
is not seeing you love
not seeing you
because always you exist everywhere
but you exist better where I love you
because your mouth is blood
and you are cold
I have to love you love
I have to love you
even though this wound hurts like two
even though I search for you without finding you
and even though
the night passes and I have you
and I dont
to trini
To defend joy as a trench
To defend it from scandal and routine
From misery and the miserable
From temporary leaves
And definitive ones
To defend joy as a principle
To defend it from wonders and nightmares
From neutrals and neutrons
From sweet infamies
And grave diagnosis
To defend joy as a flag
To defend it from lightning and melancholy
From naïves and rogues
From rethorics and heart attacks
From endemics and academies
To defend joy as a destiny
To defend it from fire and firemen
From suicidal and homicidal
From holidays and stress
From the duty of being joyful
To defend joy as a certainty
To defend it from rust and dirt
From the famed patina of time
From fog and opportunism
From the pimps of laughter
To defend joy as a right
To defend it from god and winter
From capital letters and death
From surnames and pity
From chance
And also from joy.
With its steely ritual
its great chimneys
its secret sages
its siren song
its neon skies
its christmas sales
its cult of god the father
and epaulettes
with its keys to the kingdom
the north is the one in charge
but here down
down everywhere the hungry
view the bitter fruit
of what others decide
while time passes
and parades pass
and other things are done
that the north doesnt ban
with enduring hope
the south also exists
with its preachers
its poisonous gases
its chicago school
its owners of land
with luxury clothes and
feeble bones
its worn-out defences
its defence spend
on launching invasions
the North is the one in charge
down hidden away
are the men and women
who know what to hold onto
making the most of the sun
and also eclipses
setting aside the useless
and using what works
with its age-old faith
with its french horn
and its swedish academy
its american sauce
and its english made spanners
with all its missiles
and its encyclopedias
its star wars
and its affluent anger
with all its awards
but here down down
close to the roots
is where the memory
doesn't blank out any memory
and there are those who die for something
and there are those who live for something
and between them they achieve
what was supposed to be impossible
to make the whole world know
that the south also exists.
I am the perfect
secretary.
My boss is elegant
my boss is ever so discrete
hes tall, hes distinguished,
hes the perfect boss.
When he comes and asks me:
Make me a copy,
My boss has a wife,
two kids and three maids,
his wife at least
knows nothing about it.
When he comes and tells me:
We are made for each other,
My boss has a mustang
and an apartment
where we go sometimes
his conscience and I.
So to keep him happy I say
Its just a minor sin,
My boss behaves
like any other mature man
he disguises his paunch
when he dresses in the dark.
And when he yawns and says
Not today, Im not well,
When my boss goes -
that old man, my boss -
I calm myself down and remain
alone in front of the mirror.
And I repeat to myself
that worn-out phrase:
I am the perfect
secretary.
What if God was a woman?Juan Gelman
What if God was a woman?
Ask Juan undeterred.
Go go, if God was a woman
It is possible that agnostics and atheists
No we said no with head
And we said yes with guts.
Maybe we approached to its divine nudity
For kissing his feet not of bronze
Her pubis not of stone
Her breasts not of marble
Her lips not of plaster.
If God was a woman, we embrace her
The distance to boot your
And we should not swear
Until death take us away
Since it would be immortal quintessential
And instead of transmitting AIDS or panic
We rub off their immortality.
If God was a woman not be installed
Far in the kingdom of heaven
But we wait in the vestibule of hell
With your open arms
Its pink that isn't plastic
And her love not of angels.
Oh my God, my God
If until forever and from always
You were a woman
How nice scandal it would be
What fortunate splendid impossible
Prodigious blasphemy.
Your hands are my caress
my daily reminders
I love you because your hands
work for justice
if I love you it's because you are
my love my accomplice and my everything
and in the street arm in arm
we are many more than two
your eyes are my spell
against a cursed day
I love you for your gaze
that looks and plants the future
your mouth that is yours and mine
your mouth doesnt lie
I love you because your mouth
knows how to shout rebellion
and for your open face
and your wanderers footstep
and your weeping for the world
because you are of the people I love you.
and because love is not a halo
nor morality tale
and because we are a couple
that knows it is not alone
I love you in my paradise
which is to say that in my ideal country
people live happily
without even having permission
I have fear of seeing you
necessity of seeing you
hope of seeing you
uneases of seeing you.
I have willingness of finding you
worry of finding you
certainty of finding you
poor doubts of finding you.
I have urgency of hearing you
happiness of hearing you
good luck of hearing you
and fears of hearing you.
So to speak
summarizing
I am fucked
and radiant
perhaps more the former
than the last
and also
vice versa.
The spotlights have damaged my vision and memory
I was Hamlet, Don Juan, a sixteenth-century
noble gentleman, adventurous and sensual.
I was flattered by applause, that remnant of glory.
The press photos, the cocktails... It was grand,
my life, and so easy. Inside, the set
was being collapsed. (Life has cost me
more dearly than most.) I was rich and lustful.
I had what men value: I had lovers,
traveled the world, had that vile thing:
fame. Now at the end, who am I?
Good-bye, the curtain will fall for the last time. The flowers
that await me are bitter. What will be left of me? 
In the world's balconies my name was a god's.
That old café with its bourgeoisie gatherings
evoked in the lines of Fernando Fortún
portrays a rosy age of mascara, marchionesses,
modernist groups, silk, and puns.
A time I would like to have known
—the drunkenness of Rubén, the boldness of Valle—
keeping the speech of the street in my poems
and the purple echo of Stéphane Mallarmé.
I would not mind boarding-house poverty
if my verses enjoyed the endorsement and praise
of Machado (Manuel) and Leopoldo Lugones.
But my time is another. I live impoverished
with fifteen rooms, my verses go on sale
and those figures are names in Espasa.
Any city is a secret.
Any instant is magic and fatal:
the conjunction of ourselves and time.
Every word traces a labyrinth.
Any labyrinth can be escaped with words.
There is always a full moon in desire.
Always a dead moon in memory.
Chance forever follows hazy laws:
when you least expect it,
someone opens your hand and shows you a key
bright as gold
and tells you, Its your key.
Every city bestows some secret.
Every secret is always decisive.
In chaos there is an occult order:
that which never happened is called life.
for Juan Sierra
Holy Thursday nights. Large candles shine
climbing the hillside of San Bartolomé.
Girls toss stockings to rowdy boyfriends
returning from drinking.
The Virgin with daggers seems to have left
some criminal den, wounded, without honor.
Her crown of pearls weighs more than Oblivion,
more than her heart.
They dance, sway her like a feather. With jewels,
her figure shines like the April moon.
The Lady seems to have taken pills
mixed with anise.
Magistrates, priests, altar  boys, penitents
move in procession. The crowd speaks Latin.
The shopkeeper's daughter, a smiling houri
draws back the curtain.
Close to the house of the Four Balconies,
an angel disguised as a fatal manola
solemnly places her floral mantilla
over the mayor.
That son of the great She-Mule
through Mola he came to do mischief.
As he didn't have any soldiers,
he made them up out of soutanes.
From far away the traitor Franco
sends him only promises
and taking him for a Mule
proclaims the coming of mulatto troops.
Now they're asking for war mothers,
these troops from the mehallas.
The Crescent now has the protection
of those zealously pious women.
And how they cure their wounds,
and how the Moor gives them
bloodied bunches of flowers
filled with severed ears!
On mules they go towards Mola
shouting for their pay.
Mola strings them along with marks,
those from Germany, long out of use.
Fierce Moor, they tricked you,
are going to trick you, are tricking you!
And from all parts
come the cracking voices
of drunken generals
spouting drivel over the radio.
Meanwhile, against these tales
which the fascists raise,
hammers and sickles smash
their clear truths.
And in battle our Militias
go about singing of their joy,
victorious over the death that lies
in ambush for their militiawomen;
always putting their bullets
where they've put their eyes.
The light of day breaks out
there in front of the Guadarrama,
bloodstaining the lights of hope
with the light of dawn.
On the other side of the hills
is the death of Spain.
From that corner bathed by the flashes
of the sun that fills our triumphant sky;
from the flowering earth where among flowers
my sweet and serene infancy slipped in,
wrapped in the memories of my past
which is blurred in the distant horizon;
I watch the strange specimen, never forgotten,
of the oddest sower there was on the mountain.
I still don't know if he was wise, crazy or prudent,
that man who was dressed in humble attire;
I only know that on looking at him, everyone
regarded him with deep respect.
And it's perhaps that his stern and noble gesture
astonished all for being arrogant:
Even the woodsmen looking at the oak tree
feel the majesties of the giant!
One autumn afternoon I went up to the mountain
and as I looked at the sower, I watched smiling.
Ever since men existed on the earth
none have toiled with such determination!
I wanted to know, curious, what the madman
planted on the mountain lone and brave.
The poor wretch listened to me kindly
and said with deep melancholy:
"I plant flowers, pines and sycamores;
I want to fill this hill with fronds,
I want others to enjoy the treasures
that these plants will give when I die."
"Why so much effort in a day's work without
seeking reward?", I said. And the madman
murmured, with his hands on the hoe:
-"Maybe you think that I am mistaken;
perhaps, being a boy, it really amazes you
the unlimited impulse that ignites my soul;
for those who do not work, I work and struggle;
if the world does not know it, God understands me!"
Today selfishness is the stupid master
to whom we pay homage in several ways:
if we pray, we ask solely for our own bread.
Never to heaven do we ask for bread for everyone!
In our own misery, eyes fixed,
we look for riches that are in our own interest
and we confront everything for our children.
Is it perhaps that other parents don't have children?
We live being brothers in name only
and in brutal wars, with thirst for thievery.
There is always a fratricidal within man;
and the man, for man, is always a wolf.
That is why when I contemplate on this sad world,
I labor and impose on myself a rough job
and I know that my poor example is worth a lot,
though poor and humble it seems and is.
We must fight for those who do not fight!
We must demand for all those who do not beg!
We must make those who do not listen to hear us!
We must cry for all who do not cry!
We must be like the bees in the hive
that make for all, sweet honeycombs.
We must be like the water that flows serenely
offering the whole world fresh streams.
We must imitate the wind that plants flowers,
the same in the mountain as in the plains.
We must live life sowing loves,
with the sight and the soul always in exaltation."
Said the madman, and with noble melancholy,
through the thicket of the mountain he continued climbing
and on losing himself in the shadows, still repeating:
"We must live sowing, always planting!..."
Will you be brave? The old man asks the young man.
In exile, bread is bitter, first and last;
All roads are rough, each hour is full of sorrow.
Erect, I like a tree shall face the blast!
Will you be brave, boy? To a man in exile
Each neighbor's hand becomes a claw, to smite;
Slander and hate will set their dogs upon you.
The hired lash only barks, it does not bite!
When, with grey mists around you and within you,
You think of your blue mountains fair and free,
Your mother, brothers, and your dearest comrades—
Closing mine eyes, my country I shall see!
But when you meet by moonlight loving couples
And hear upon the wind their laughter gay,
Your lover's heart, will it remain indifferent?
Will it not sigh, or have a word to say?
Will it not then recall some eyes celestial,
Long chestnut locks, beloved in other years?
The youth makes no reply. His eyes grow misty.
Go, lad! The old man says. You now know tears!
I observed when you snatched viciously me away 
my loved ones, and then I judged you:
relentless like misfortune, inexorable
like pain and cruel like the doubt...
But today that you, cold, mute, approach me
without hate and without love, neither sullen nor affable,
my spirit greets your majesty
of the unfathomable and your eternity.
I, without the impatience of the suicide,
neither the dread of the happy, nor the inert fear
of the criminal, I await your coming;
that equal to everyone's luck is my fortune:
if nothing is expected of life,
something must be expected from death.
When I'm reaching the last page
of the tragicomedy of my life,
I look back at the starting point
with the pain of those who expect nothing.
So much noble ambitions that was chimera!
What a beautiful faded illusion!
Sown is the path traveled
with the flowers of that spring!
But in this gloomy, somber hour,
of severe truth and disenchantment,
of supreme pain and agony,
it is my greatest regret, in my brokenness,
not having loved more, I who believed...
I who thought I had loved so much!
Trust me, I'm in the middle of my room
waiting for rain. I'm alone. I don't care
if I finish my poem or not. I wait for rain,
drinking coffee and through the window watching a beautiful landscape
of courtyards, with clothes hanging still,
silent marble clothes in the city, where wind
does not exist and far off you only hear the hum
of a color TV, watched by a family
who's also, at this hour, drinking coffee together around
a table: trust me: the yellow plastic tables
unfold into the horizon and beyond:
into the suburbs where they're building
apartments, and a boy of 16 atop a stack
of red bricks contemplates the machines' movement.
The sky in the boy's hour is an enormous
hollow screw the breeze plays with. And the boy
plays with ideas. With ideas and with frozen scenes.
Inertia is a heavy transparent mist
emerging from his eyes.
Trust me: it isn't love that's drawing near
but beauty with its stole of dead dawns.
Nights I've slept between faces and words,
Bodies bent by wind,
Lines I watched spellbound
At the edge of my dreams.
Freezing European nights, my body in the ghetto
But dreaming.
At the back of a strange barnyard,
Books or pieces of meat
Nerves hooked on a skeleton
Or printed paper.
A vase or the door
To nightmares.
He's embarrassed, that damn Roberto     Closes his eyes
(Cheeks turn red)
He reads books in the Granja Parisina on Tallers Street
He walks through the port's back alleys in the
drizzle     (A really lame film
starring Robert De Niro)     But
why is he blushing?     (Damn Robert Bolaño:
kissing the pathetic and the ridiculous on the lips)
He opens his eyes like a skinny, dying bear
(A bear? You?)     Like R.A. Lafferty's Snuffles
He's embarrassed, he walks in the drizzle of the port
He stops in front of the movie posters
He reads in the Céntrico bar on Ramalleras Street
Freud Lacan Cooper     (Seriously)
He doesn't cover his tracks
I was happy during the hunts.
I dozed in a plane tree's shade.
My dreams ordained rivers and castles.
At dawn my brother whispered in my ear
that behind those hills the dominions
went on with the same wire fencing.
Homages—he said. I rode horseback
until I reached the vanguard.
No one could point out where
our lord had gone.
I sensed the heat of the sunsets
was artificial. I found that
someone had slept a long time
on my writings.
I remember Plato told me
and I didn't pay attention.
Now I'm in death's nightclub
and there's nothing I can do:
space is a paradox.
Nothing can happen here
and yet here I am.
Just a robot
with an unspecified mission.
An eternal work of art.
Nothing will be left of our hearts.
Peire Cardenal. Before your words
A white ashtray full of rings.
The Albigenses hidden in Barcelona.
In any case, songs and wine.
A white ashtray full of fingers.
In comic books we find freedom.
Nor ofthe stone roofs that saw us.
Go pale.
Francis Bacon
Learned to live
Alone
Learned to bear
The slowness
Of human dusk
Its unbearable stench
Learned
The art of patience
Similar in many ways
To the art of indifference
Francis Bacon learned
To live with hours
To live with shadows
Masks
Of some illegible
Freedom
The cat who was kind yesterday
is talking today     We figure that
black thoughts are also
heliocentric ships     Longing
always escapes from treacherous
Pavlovian ambushes
Toward the nucleus of revolution
Drinking a radiance called whisky
Ask the writer:
what will become of all these people?
Sometimes I'm incredibly happy
It doesn't matter what I tell you
Guiraut de Bornelh the rain
You scratch your neck absentmindedlywhile you contemplate
a panel painted with the Virgin and Child
Behind them, leafy trees, and even further back
the hills appear and disappear
through the curtain of rain
In a corner of the hermitage an old man complains
It's time to get away from these lands
You scratch your belly     In your mind
you compose a sunrise
Chelita lives amid essences
amid absolute ideas and perfumes
thin proletariat body
now and forever a vagabond
a virtual shadow of Chile in Europe
who doesn't pull oflf the word artisan
or a murmur of stagnant water
or a dream of love and innocence
The 20-year-old inmigrant punk, penknife on
the neck of the Chilean, 25, only tourist out at that hour
The penknife is white like the windows at that penniless hour
and both their images overlap
a couple seconds. The lyrics of a song, a café
con leche, an injection, some corduroys that smell
like shit, a woman's nose, a summer tan,
the actual hands of someone drawing back a curtain.
Communion. He takes a step back and looks at his
attacker's face (he could just as well say: his guide).
Waves of broken words can't seem to come out of his
belly, a kind of haste to undress the younger
man he has in front of him and checkmate. Between
the arches of the Martorell plaza in Barcelona, he takes a step back
as if the game had never ended, maps from
15 years ago, desire that only manifests itself in a half-smile
And traces a pyramid, a buffalo, something like stars
the boy's black arm, but his penknife doesn't shine
because in the Chilean's mind it's already a key.
The clouds split. Darkness
opens, pale furrow in the sky.
The thing emerging from the background
is the sun. The clouds' core,
once absolute, now glows like a
crystallized boy. Streets covered
in branches, wet leaves, tracks.
I've stayed calm throughout the storm
and now reality opens up.
Wind drags groups of clouds
in diflferent directions.
I thank heaven for having made love
to the women I've cared about.
From the darkness, pale furrow,
the days come forth like travelling boys.
Spring opens eyes upon
Gibraltar's sheets of sound
It's raining and you say it's as if the clouds
were crying. Then cover your mouth and speed up
your step. As if those emaciated clouds were crying?
Impossible. So then, why all this rage,
This desperation that'll bring us all to hell?
Nature hides some of her methods
in Mystery, her stepbrother. And so, sooner than
you think, this afternoon you consider
an afternoon of the apocalypse, will seem nothing but
a melancholy afternoon, an afternoon of loneliness lost
in memory: Nature's memory. Or maybe
you'll forget it. Rain, weeping, your footsteps
resounding on the cliff-walk. They don't matter.
Right now you can cry and let your image dissolve
on the windshields of cars parked along
the boardwalk. But you can't lose yourself.
Against your wishes I tried to leave to get away
closure required swiftness
but in the end it was you who opened the door.
You were up to all kinds of things
walking crying falling down the well
and in a moment of clarity you asked about my health.
I'm not well Lola I almost never dream.
In this poem, the front line holds together.
Faces white, hands
interlacing their bodies or in their pockets.
Some close their eyes or stare at the floor.
The others are sizing you up.
Eyes drained by time. They turn back
toward each other after this pause.
The face-off only fortifies
the certitude of their union.
Horse cart and haunches fall headlong through the hole of eternity.
Through the ditch through the screech of the vulture that is the ditch.
And so carefree the aged angel's mirror?
As a city on the confines is the hole of kindness.
What could Mario be doing in Mexico?
I remember a photo he sent
from Israel,
a simple photobooth shot.
His eyes looking up at the sky.
On the back: part of a song
el cielo se está nublando
parece que va a llover. 1
Write prayers that you will whisper
before writing those poems
you will think you never wrote
My only memory of Chile is a 12-year-old girl
dancing alone on a gravel road.
I'm inside a cave
three feet tall by four feet
wide
A cave of sticks and brush
on the edge of the road.
She pushes aside the leaves and smiles at me.
Maybe now is the time
to sir ourselves down
on the keyboard
Thousands of Post-Scripts:
—Not just sit ourselves down, but...
—A gust of ugliness that makes you thirsty. Beer at one in
the morning in a German place on Avenida Pelayo.
—Waves from the province of Maule, uglinessin its sovereignty. And repeat: that prodigious Chilean who so frequently spoke when he shouldn't have, drooling his desperate ignorance of love.
—I guess when I say this I'm thinking of Mexico.
Under the gray sky—but nothing is permanent,
surrounded or protected by bare larches
the plaza comes into reality.
Barely a trickle of water leaks out
of the mosscovered fountain and on
the other end an iron arch composes
a vaguely sculptural gesture the missing stand
of something we'll never see again. It doesn't
require rain or the mind's feminine
shadows. The plaza recomposes itself as you walk away,
its stillness a traveler's blessing. Here,
on the moor there are still lines, loose
sketches of its clearly dying state.
A Chinese poet thinks around
a word without ever touching it,
without ever seeing it, without
ever representing it.
Behind the poet are mountains
yellow and dry swept by
the wind,
occasional rain,
cheap restaurants,
white clouds dispersing.
Poetry slips into dreams
like a diver in a lake.
Poetry, braver than anyone,
slips in and sinks
like lead
through a lake infinite as Loch Ness
or tragic and turbid as Lake Balaton.
Consider it from below:
a diver
innocent
covered in feathers
of will.
like a diver who's dead
in the eyes of God.
I'm in a bar and someone's name is Soni
The floor is covered in ash     Like a bird
like a single bird two old men arrive
Archilochus and Anacreon and Simonides     Miserable
Mediterranean refugees     Don't ask me what I'm doing
here, just forget that I've been with a girl
who'd pale and rich     Anyhow I only remember blush
the word shame after the word hollow
Soni! Soni!     I laid her back and rubbed
my penis all over her waist     The dog barked in the street
below there was a double feature and after coming
I thought "double feature" and the void Archilochus and Anacreon
and Simonides sheathing their willow branches     Man
doesn't search for life I said I laid her back and
shoved the whole thing in     Something crunched between
the dog's ears     Crack!     We're lost
all that's left is for you to get sick I said     And Soni
stepped away from the ground the light through dirty glass
rendered like a God and the author
closed his eyes
I don't feel safe
Anywhere.
The adventure doesn't end.
Your eyes shine in every corner.
In words
Or in money
Or in mirrors.
The Adventure never ends
And your eyes are searching for me.
They've shut down the area. The only ones
still standing are cordons
of police, lovebirds locked in
their rooms,
the barkeep indifferent and bald,
the moon in the skylight.
I dream of a weekend
full of dead police and cars
burning on the beach.
Timid young bodies, that's how
we'll sum up these years:
timid young bodies wrinkling,
smiling and studying, sprawled out
in the empty bathtub.
16 years ago Ted Berrigan published
his Sonnets. Mario passed the book around
the leprosaria of Paris. Now Mario
is in Mexico and The Sonnets  on
a bookshelf I built with my own
hands. I think I found the wood
near Montealegre nursing home
and I built the shelf with Lola. In
the winter of '78, in Barcelona, when
I still lived with Lola! And now it's been 16 years
since Ted Berrigan published his book
and maybe 17 or 18 since he wrote it
and some mornings, some afternoons,
lost in a local theatre I try reading it,
when the film ends and they turn on the light
I'm not hurting anyone, he said
asking with his whole face
why they were taking him,
Not where, but why
I'm not hurting anyone
I'm in the Hibernal. I'm listening
to cross play in the snow.
Trucks are coming from the empty forest.
I may have been drunk, but I saw
the pair of police passing through
the stationer's window and then
the restaurant's and the grocer's
and afterwards the panes of another
restaurant and a clothing store
and the clock shop until they disappeared
into the wholly blue horizon
as if swallowed by the ocean, but
which ocean? which horizon?
What do you feel, tell me what do you feel
when the birds get lost in red
and youre steadied against a wall, your pants
split and hair disheveled as if youd just
killed a president.
What do you feel in the reddening hour,
in the agitprop hour, boots sinking
into the snow of an avenue
where no one knows you.
Forked tongue of knowing how to be alone and images
that destiny (so pleasant) drags
beyond the hills.
Tell me, what do you feel. What color
do your remarkable eyes turn then.
It's nighttime and I'm in the Zone Alta
in Barcelona and I've drunk
more than three cafés con leche
with some people I don't
know beneath a moon that sometimes
seems so miserable and other times
so alone and maybe it's neither
one nor the other and I
haven't drunk coffee but cognac and cognac
and cognac in a glass restaurant
in the Zona Alta and the people I
thought I was with really
don't exist or are faces floating
at the table next to mine
where I'm alone and drunk
spending my money on one edge
of the unknown university.
At 4 a.m. old photographs of Lisa
between the pages of a science fiction novel.
My nervous system recoils like an angel.
Everything lost in the kingdom of words at
4 a.m.: the voice of the redhead sounds the depths of devotion.
Old photographs, houses in that city
where we slowly made love.
Practically a woodcut, scenes
in motionless succession, frond in the dunes.
Asleep on the table I say I was a poet,
a little too late, a loved one awakes,
no one has burned the candles of friendship
Now you walk alone along the piers
of Barcelona.
You smoke a black cigarette and for
a moment think it would be nice
if it rained.
The gods haven't granted you money
but they've granted you strange whims
Look up:
it's raining.
The protagonist is left with adventure and saying, it's started snowing, boss.
Docks     Every evil spirit brightens up
the flower's shadow     Your shadow, Gaspar
Between injections, barely smiling
(I'm 19, show some respect)     We'll erase
the dusk where the Chilean loses himself
in an absolute Barcelona     Snow
Horses     Solitude
Of chairs, of premium sunsets,
of guns stroked by
our best friends
death is made
In a thounsand years nothing will be left
of all that's been written this century.
They'll read loose sentences, traces
of lost women,
fragments of motionless children,
your slow green eyes
simply will not exist.
It will be like the Greek Anthology,
but even further away,
like a beach in winter
for another wonder, another indifference.
Two bodies in a sleeping bag
Like a chrysalis masturbating.
A cold spring morning by the sea.
Without bending, caressing whatever you could
Arms, armpits, soft hairy thighs.
Hers less so,
You'll write later with a smile alone
In a bar on the highway
Of Castelldefels.
Sleep my abyss, reflexes may tell me
detachment is total
but even in dreams you say we're all
in this together, we all
deserve to be saved
Middle Ages of long hair untouched by the wind
Provided there's wind you'll write     Wind
mathematically precise     Like the eye that has
properties of the nail     Provided there's wind you'll write
your stories for her     Measuring thickness longitude
velocity     Saying into any old stranger's ear
that tonight the wind blows from the East
A glow of steeds and troubadours on the shores
of the highway     Who hold and embellish
the wind's other words
Truth is I'm the one who's most afraid
even if it doesn't seem so     In the dusk
of Barcelona     One or two or three bottles
of dark beer     The lovely Edna so far away
A lighthouse sweeps the city three times
This imaginary city     One two three times
Edna said     Indicating a mysterious hour
for sleep     Without meeting again
Once and for all
Write red sex cross-cut by gray palm trees.
This eclipse is like your glasses falling into the abyss.
In the reading room of Hell.
With concrete men and subjective men
and those wanted by the law.
Write of widows, the abandoned ones,
the elderly, the handicapped, the mad.
Behind the Great Wars and Great Businesses
that move the world —: there they are.
Living day to day, borrowing money,
studying the little red stains
of our cities
of our sports
of our songs.
it's nice to be able to grasp something
simple and real
like missing someone.FRANK O'HARA
I listen to Barney Kessel
and smoke smoke smoke and drink tea
and try to make myself some toast
with butter and jam
but discover I have no bread and
it's already twelve thirty at night
and the only thing there is to eat
is a bottle half full
with chicken stock bought this
morning and five eggs and a
little muscatel and Barney Kessel plays
guitar stuck between a rock
and an open socket
I think I'll make consomme'
and then get into bed
to re-read The Invention  of Morel
and think about a blond girl
until I fall asleep
and start dreaming.
You wish the angst would go away
While it rains on the strange road
Where you find yourself
Rain: I just wish
The angst would go away
I'm giving it my best shot
Guiraut    Sitting on the tavern porch
Legs crossed     You've come outside to digest
watching the sky     Gray roofs
Smoking chimneys of the first days of winter
Little blonde brunette redheaded girls     Playing
I dreamt of lips
(Solitary and open? Parted by the wind?)
Lips like a platypus heart
They move between branches     Can't hear a thing
(Have they turned off the sound?The sound beneath the trees?)
Humid lips smiling at the end of my dream
Against a backdrop of leaves     The wallpaper
in this hotel room     Tireless drawing
Murmur from the Middle Ages
Beautiful unremembered moments
like the lost poetry of Bertran de Born
and Meso-American legends.
Hidden in bed, happy,
while outside it rains.
Beautiful uncharted moments without
valiant captains
to guarantee the trip home.
Where there are no girls or cities
or fires.
Just your body
wrapped in a dirty raincoat,
recicling on the beach,
reading.
The stranger is sprawled on the bed. Passing through loveless scenes (smooth bodies, sadomasochistic toys, pills and grimaces of the
unemployed) you get to the point you call autumn  and discover the stranger.
In the bedroom, in addition to the reflection that sucks up everything, you notice stones, yellow reefs, sand, hair on pillows, abandoned
pajamas. Then it all disappears.
Switchblade to the neck and the
teenager's voice cracks
give me everything     give me everything
or I'll cut  you
and the moon swells
through his air
The snow falling over Gerona
So these were the rhythms?
Turns of sweet indifference
Like lighthouses at dusk
There's nothing more gentle more alone
Blood coagulated on horizontal glass.
Nice nice nice
like Barcelona in the middle of '79
Matters put in verse by Joan Airas are on your mind now
Poor and free and paranoid
The only dark shape beside your bed
is the backpack
I pray to God you don't get sick
The vases conceal
The door of Hell
With a particular light
And at a certain time
You suddenly realize:
That object is terror
It's hardly surprising that the author's room is full of allusive posters. Naked, he paces around contemplating the peeling walls, where
he begins to make out signs, nervous drawings, out-of-context phrases.
Ringing in the kaleidoscope, like an echo, are the voices of all those he used to be, and this he calls his patience.
Patience in Gerona before the Third War.
A benign autumn.
Her scent barely lingers in the room...
The perfume was called Fleeting butcher shop...
A famous doctor had operated on the left eye...
Expect nothing of combat.
Combat seeks blood.
And justifies itself with blood.
Behind the queens legs,
Sweetly parted for the dick
Of the king, are torched
Cabins, headless bodies,
The noble gaze bewitched by death.
I asked if she was still there.
She said she'd come by.
It's snowing again, I warned.
Books scattered.
Useless for love making.
6 months since I'd brought a girl
to my place.
Emphatic, categorical, she pointed out
a fly squashed
on the other side of the window.
Like spitting at a mirror, I recalled.
A kind of poet.
Carefree and happy.
According to Alain Resnais
toward the end of his life
Lovecraft was a night watchman
at a theatre in Providence.
Pale, holding a cigarette
between two lips, five feet
seven inches tall
I read this at night
in Estrella de Mar campground.
My gift to you will be an abyss, she said,
but it will be so subtle you'll perceive it
only after many years have passed
and you are far from Mexico and me.
You'll find it when you need it most,
and that won't be
the happy ending,
but it will be an instant of emptiness and joy.
And maybe then you'll remember me,
if only just a little.
I deserved every bit of it, boss, don't turn on the light.
Silent cars of a foreign city.
I have no idea where I am, what is this place,
the last image of reality, at least that I remember,
was a girl closing the metal shutters
of a corner store.
What happened to that girl?
I have no idea, I just remember she was a redhead
and she looked at me for a second
and then started running down the street
toward the center of this miserable town.
All the stores were closed today
plus I only had 50 pesetas
Three tomatoes and an egg
That was all
And softly as in a morning sunrise.
Coltrane live
And I ate just fine
Cigarettes and tea within reach.
And patience in dusk's
compass.
A woman's voice says she loves
the shadow which may be your own
Disguised as a cop, you watch
the falling snow     But when?
You don't remember     You were in the street
and it was snowing on your police uniform
But still you could see her:
a beautiful girl straddling
a black motorcycle
at the end of the road
Go to hell, Roberto, and remember you'll never
stick it in again
She had a peculiar smell
Long freckled legs
Mahogany hair and beautiful clothes
To be honest I don't remember much now
She loved me forever
She crushed me
42
From the sadness that falls down,
from the pain that tires me,
from my office, from the mess of my room,
from these lonely mans blankets,
from this paper, I extend my hand.
I can no longer only be
the one who says goodbye alone, who lives
of such naked separations
that not even hope
do they give in return; he who in a book
undresses himself and learns and teaches
the same poverty, page by page.
I am writing to you all
so you know my address,
in case youd like to answer.
I write my letter to tell you
this is indeed what happens: we are sick
of time, of the air itself,
of the grief we breathe,
of the loneliness that falls upon us.
I just pretend to talk to someone,
to speak and listen. Its no big deal.
With people who seem different
I walk, I work with every day;
and I do not greet anyone: I fear.
I know that should not be, that perhaps
someone needs me without knowing it.
I need them too. Now
I say it out loud, simply.
I wrote at the beginning: I extend my hand.
I hope someone understands it.
Everyday in the world
Something beautiful ends
Jaroslav Seifert
Suffer:
Like an old tired star
light has left you. And the creature
you lighted
(and who lighted
your eyes blind to the trivial things
of the world)
is now a mortal again.
Everything recovers
its density, its weight, its volume,
the poor equilibrium that sustains
your new winter. Be happy.
Your viscera now is your viscera again
and not the coarse food of worry.
You are no longer yet that drunk god and uncertain
that you turned out to be. Bite
the bone they give you,
down to its marrow,
pick up the crumbs that memory leaves behind.
Your mouth comes to me, only your mouth.
It comes flying,
dragonfly of blood, suddenly ablaze
that puts fire to my this night of ashes.
All the salt of the sea dwells in her,
all the rumor of the sea,
all the foam.
Mouth for the kisses drawn,
where your tempting tongue sleeps.
All the wine of the world is in your mouth,
all the sin,
and all the innocence.
Mouth that keeps silence when to tell a secret.
Your mouth, capable of all the truth,
of all the truth and the lie.
Laughter from your mouth awakens the day.
(Lightning of snow is there in your laughter).
Like a troop of colts, the kisses
Of your sweet mouth knock me down;
your mouth, an errant butterfly,
your alien mouth gets blurred
in the circle of my night and ashes.
Sad men scare the birds away,
the clouds descend down
to their brooding foreheads
and break into sheer, opaque rain.
The flowers languish
in the gardens of sad men.
Their steep downfall tempts the death.
Whereas,
The women within a woman
are born at the same time
right before the eyes of sad men.
The woman-vessel open her belly again
and offers him her redeeming milk.
The woman-child kisses with fervor
his paternal hands, the hands of a desolate widower.
She walks there silently in the house
brightens his hours and patches up
all the holes in his breast.
There is something else she lends him:
her two hands, as if they were wings.
But the sad men cant listen their music.
There is then no woman more lonely,
more lonely in sadness,
than the one who loves a sad man.
When in a fit of anger my father killed the cat,
Bartolo my cat
because it put its tail in his broth
and because it was already old and didnt catch mice as it should
and because it was expensive to maintain,
when my drunk father killed it with his hands
there was a noisy confusion at home.
All came, all:
my sister said: save me the eyes
for a pair of earrings, and Martino,
our blind neighbor, bagged the guts
—you can make violin strings with them—
and mother, who cried at first, cried with me;
she wanted the fur
to put as a collar on her jacket,
and the whiskers
were bagged by my brother Eladio the mechanic,
and the fur on its paws became
nice pincushions
for the fat witch that lives at the back of the courtyard
and is a dressmaker.
What was left they boiled with salt and onions.
They gave it to Luis, who sleeps on our street,
because with it you can also make cat broth for the hungry.
I asked for the bones.
I bite them one after another in front of my sisters mirror
because my grandmother said
that if you bite the right one you become invisible.
Love turned me glad enough (that
for its praise I thus employ my lay)
—No man I ever led astray
by taking him to love's sad habitat. 
This does my judgment deem essential
to save men from themselves... by my becoming
Love's warning against the real potential
of their (thus) succumbing— 
O you that journey (after my poetry)
liking to read about adversity
infinite—because it's caused by love: All 
my poems say is this—It is a blessed soul
who, getting God's most solemn sympathy,
is freed of Love's most comedy.
Sweet dream it was and also sweet affliction,
when I was dreaming that it was a dream;
a sweet delight I'd take in what deceived me,
if only that deception longer seemed;
a sweet not being in myself, I saw
every good thing I'd ever want to see;
a sweet pleasure it was, though so intense
that sometimes it would just awaken me:
oh sleep, how much more gentle and delightful
you'd be if you would come so heavily
that with more calm you'd set on me your weight!
For while I slept, in short, I was in bliss,
and it is right that one be blessed in lies
who's always been in truth unfortunate.
Love in itself is naturally good,
And if therefrom we suffer such grave ills,
'tis that our passion runs to such extremes,
and thus we come to grief by our own fault.
Of all the elements that Nature holds
the noblest and most excellent is fire.
But if one heaps upon it too much wood,
its ardent force can set the world ablaze.
How much more so if one adds other fuel,
as pitch or tar, to urge combustion on.
Such those that I did cast in my sad state!
For this, while pining under Cupid's heat,
I got so scorchèd, as I fanned the flame,
that folly's burns show clearly on my face.
Like one receiving pleasure from a dream,
his pleasure thus proceeding from delusion,
so does imagination with illusions
conceive in vain its happiness in me.
No other good's inscribed on my sad heart,
except what in my thoughts I might procure;
of all the good I ever have endured,
what lives is only the imagined part.
My heart is frightened to proceed ahead,
seeing that its pain in ambush lies;
and so after a moment it turns back
to contemplate those glories that have fled.
Oh, shadow of relief, that fickle flies,
to make what's best in me be what I lack!
I was so long abased and full of woes,
because base Love still held me in its thrall,
that people, sick and healthy, were dismayed
at sight of one by illness so deform'd.
It soon became my lot to walk apart,
as those around me shunned my cursed face.
And in this plight what gave me most relief
was to gorge on thoughts of my unlucky state.
Then, all at once, I found myself restored,
and all my ills turned suddenly to joy;
everyone who saw my new-found health
stood half-wondering and half-aggrieved,
like those who saw the blind man healed by Christ
astonishèd to see that he could see.
O! what a blockhead is Don Andres,
So spending his gold without measure,
Who ruins, perhaps, to be a Marquess,
His house by the waste of his treasure!
A cross on his breast to wear so prim,
Much be the good it will do to him!
Louis is passing the whole long night,
In the dance, what a fancy to take!
So foolish too, when he easier might
On his warm soft bed his comfort make;
To stretch as he pleased each weary limb:
O, how short-sighted is Avarice!
Cenon exposes himself to shame,
For the few pounds more he gains amiss,
To lose his office and his good name;
For a paltry bribe his fame to dim,
Much be the good it will do to him.
And Clara! what of thee shall I say?
When slowly along I see thee go,
As if quite lame on the public way,
And on thy long broad foot bestow
A short narrow shoe for us to see?
Much be the good it will do to thee!
Can it be possibly true, Jerome,
Though yearly he sees his rents decrease,
When his fat steward shall bring him home
His bills, will sign them as he may please?
Without any search to scarcely skim?
Fabio wedded with Jane, when above
A sixpence they neither had, but then
He loved her so! Long life to that love,
Bravo! tomorrow if he seem fain
To hang himself with vexation grim,
Wouldst thou engage with the bulls in fight,
My friend! thy wish to be gratified,
When to the best champion known will light
Some luckless thrust give through the right side?
To try thy skill thou art surely free:
Martin goes a poor rabbit to chase,
When he could buy for a trifle one
Fully as good in the market-place;
And he gets fever-struck by the sun!
Well, at the least he has had his whim:
If when such a thing he least expects,
His house should tumble upon his head,
Because a doubloon Anton neglects
To give for mending the roof instead,
The hole some rat had made in the rim,
If should some crusty reader exclaim
Over these lines,—What a wretched style!
What a bad taste to make it his aim!
My pen more gracefully could the while
Have made the verse go easy and trim,
Strange, on this night, I recall
A vanished image. The beggar
Of my childhood, with hairy face, returns
His harsh look from another world.
He came at noon, and a growl
Of old animal announced him. (All
The house was open, and summer
Was coming in from the sea). The child
Walked with fear to the door and placed
A coin in his hand. The voice was
Rough, the eyes cold from hate,
And I felt very afraid as I approached,
All pity dispelled. Violently
Death circled round me with its shadow.
Only later, when I saw the grown-ups
Talk indifferently, already back,
Did my heart grow calm. I stayed
Near the window and, facing the sea,
Remembered gloomy stories.
Tonight, so much time gone by,
His terrible and mysterious presence
Keeps me from sleep. I suffered
No harm from that will, and
The man shall have died now, impoverished
As he lived. In those years, many
Other beggars stopped by the houses
Of the village. They all lie below, unavenged.
Oblivion finished them. Vague, broken,
Their shadows spring up; memory stirs
A cold, vast and lonely kingdom.
Powerful, now they give me back
The miserable alms: the pity
That, each day, man needs
To keep on living. And that fear
Wich I felt as a child troubles
My life now, its failure: an old man
Looked at me with innoncent eyes.
You already live the season of the postponed time:
you named it the autumn of the roses.
Inhale them and inflame. And listen,
when heaven extinguishes, to the silence of the world.
Here in her little room all still and lone
The things that made her life are greeting me.
It seems as though her body as it went
Had left a spirit footprint, mindfully.
'Twould seem as in the mirror-moon were shown
The shadowy glimpse of what she used to be;—
And sing more sad her bird its caged lament,—
And through the room her absence whisper free—
Her gilt-edged book of prayers is lying there
Upon the table; and it says: "The care
Is small of worldlings, — Upon God, thine eye!"
I raise my glance, and in my grief I moan:—
Oh, had I but, that final hour, known
The anguished sweetness of her last goodbye!
I tell you good-bye, though perhaps I want you still.
Maybe I should not forget you, but I tell you good-bye.
I do not know if you wanted me I do not know if I wanted you
Or maybe the both of us wanted too much.
This sad, and passionate, and crazy tenderness
I sowed into my soul so that I would love you.
I do not know if I loved you a lot... I do not know if I loved you a little;
but I do know that I will never love this way again.
I am left with your smile asleep in my memory,
and my heart tells me that I will not forget you ;
but, remaining all alone, knowing that I am losing you,
perhaps I begin to love you as I never loved you.
I tell you good-bye, and perhaps, with this farewell,
my most beautiful dream dies inside me
But I tell you good-bye, for all my life,
although all my life I will continue thinking of you.
You may go and it will not matter, since you remain with me
Like there remains a perfume where a flower has been.
You know that I love you, but I don't say it to you;
And I know that you are mine, without your love being mine.
Life brings us near and Time sunders us apart,
Like Day and Night, at Dawn...
My thirsty heart longs for your clear water,
But it is another's water which I must not drink...
For this reason you can go, because, although I don't follow you
Like a scar you never go away entirely;
And my soul is as a furrow when the wheat is cut
And losing the ear it retains the root.
My love for you is like a river, that seems deeper,
Inexplicably, when the water is gone.
And I am at the edge, watching the bottom,
Since your love and death have an afterlife.
For a love like this, all of life is too little
All of life is too little for a dream like this
Thinking about you, tonight, I will kiss another mouth;
and you will be with another ... but thinking about me!
People now murmur that I am your enemy
For they claim that in verses I reveal your essence to the world.
They lie, Julia de Burgos. They lie Julia de Burgos.
The voice uplifted in my verses is not your own: it is mine,
For you are garment and I essence;
And the greatest abyss lies between the two.
You are the cold-blooded puppet of social deceit,
And I, the driving splendour of human truth.
You, of courtesan hypocrisies...the honey; not I;
Whose heart is revealed in my poems... all.
You are like your world, selfish; not I;
Who dares all to be what I truly am.
You are merely the implacable, elegant lady;
Not I; I am life, I am strength, I am woman.
You belong to your husband, to your master; not I;
I belong to no one, or to everyone, because to all, everyone,
In wholesome feeling and thought, I give myself.
You curl your locks and paint yourself, not I;
I am curled by the wind; brightened by the sun.
You are homebound, resigned, submissive,
Confined to the whims of men; not I;
I am Rocinante galloping recklessly
Wandering through the boundaries of God's justice.
You are not in command of self; everyone rules you:
You are ruled by your husband, your parents, relatives,
The priest, the seamstress, theatre, club,
The car, jewels, the banquet, champagne,
Heaven and hell and... social hearsay.
But not me, I am ruled by my heart alone,
My sole thought; it is "I" who rules myself.
You, aristocratic blossom; and I, the people's blossom.
You are well provided for, but are indebted to everyone,
While I, my nothingness to no one owe.
You, nailed to the stagnant ancestral dividend;
And I, but one digit in the social cipher.
We are the encroaching, inevitable duel to the death.
When the multitude uncontrolled runs,
The ashes of injustices, burnt, left behind,
And when with the torch of the seven virtues,
The throng to the seven sins gives chase,
I will be against you and against all that is unjust and inhuman.
Upholding the torch... I shall be among the throng.
Ay, ay, ay, that am kinky-haired and pure black
kinks in my hair, Kafir in my lips;
and my flat nose Mozambiques.
Black of pure tint, I cry and laugh
the vibration of being a black statue;
a chunk of night, in which my white
teeth are lightning;
and to be a black vine
which entwines in the black
and curves the black nest
in which the raven lies.
Black chunk of black in which I sculpt myself,
ay, ay, ay, my statue is all black.
They tell me that my grandfather was the slave
for whom the master paid thirty coins.
Ay, ay, ay, that the slave was my grandfather
is my sadness, is my sadness.
If he had been the master
it would be my shame:
that in men, as in nations,
if being the slave is having no rights
being the master is having no conscience.
Ay, ay, ay wash the sins of the white King
in forgiveness black Queen.
Ay, ay, ay, the race escapes me
and buzzes and flies toward the white race,
to sink in its clear water;
or perhaps the white will be shadowed in the black.
Ay, ay, ay my black race flees
and with the white runs to become bronzed;
to be one for the future,
fraternity of America!
Nothing troubles my being, but I am sad.
Something slow and dark strikes me,
though just behind this agony,
I have held the stars in my hand.
It must be the caress of the useless,
the unending sadness of being a poet,
of singing and singing, without breaking
the greatest tragedy of existence.
To be and not want to be... that's the motto,
the battle that exhausts all expectation,
to find, when the soul is almost dead,
that the miserable body still has strength.
Forgive me, oh love, if I do not name you!
Apart from your song I am dry wing.
Death and I sleep together...
Only when I sing to you, I awake.
Life straightened up to watch me pass.
I began getting lost atom by atom of my flesh
and slipping little by little to the soul.
Pilgrim in myself, I walked a long instant.
I lingered on the route of that errant path
that opened in my interior
and I arrived at myself, intimate.
With myself on horseback I galloped through the shadow of time
and became a landscape far from my vision.
I knew myself as a message far from the world.
I felt myself a life inverted from the surface of colors and forms,
and saw myself a light scaring mans shadow emptied on the earth.
A clock has sounded the hour chosen by all.
The hour? Any. All in one.
The surroundings reconquer color and form.
Men move unaware
to grab the minute hand
that points them in several static directions.
Always the same flesh silently tightening on the familiar.
I seek myself. I am still in the landscape far from my vision.
I go on being a message from the world.
The form that recedes and that was mine an instant
has left me intimate.
And I see myself a light scaring mans shadow emptied on the earth.
Rio Grande de Loiza!... Elongate yourself in my spirit
and let my soul lose itself in your rivulets,
finding the fountain that robbed you as a child
and in a crazed impulse returned you to the path.
Coil yourself upon my lips and let me drink you,
to feel you mine for a brief moment,
to hide you from the world and hide you in yourself,
to hear astonished voices in the mouth of the wind.
Dismount for a moment from the loin of the earth,
and search for the intimate secret in my desires;
confuse yourself in the flight of my bird fantasy,
and leave a rose of water in my dreams.
Rio Grande de Loiza!... My wellspring, my river
since the maternal petal lifted me to the world;
my pale desires came down in you from the craggy hills
to find new furrows;
and my childhood was all a poem in the river,
and a river in the poem of my first dreams.
Adolescence arrived. Life surprised me
pinned to the widest part of your eternal voyage;
and I was yours a thousand times, and in a beautiful romance
you awoke my soul and kissed my body.
Were did you take the waters that bathed
my body in a sun blossom recently opened?
Who knows on what remote Mediterranean shore
some faun shall be possessing me!
Who knows in what rainfall of what far land
I shall be spilling to open new furrows;
or perhaps, tired of biting hearts
I shall be freezing in icicles!
Rio Grande de Loiza!... Blue. Brown. Red.
Blue mirror, fallen piece of blue sky;
naked white flesh that turns black
each time the night enters your bed;
red stripe of blood, when the rain falls
in torrents and the hills vomit their mud.
Man river, but man with the purity of river,
because you give your blue soul when you give your blue kiss.
Most sovereign river mine. Man river. The only man
who has kissed my soul upon kissing my body.
Rio Grande de Loiza!... Great river. Great flood of tears.
The greatest of all our islands tears
save those greater that come from the eyes
of my soul for my enslaved people.
I'm going to make a seawall
with my small happiness...
I don't want the sea to know
that pains go through my breast.
I don't want the sea to touch
the shore of my earth...
I have run out of dreams,
crazy from shadows in the sand.
I don't want the sea to look
at blue mourning in my path...
(My eyelids were auroras
when the storm crossed!)
I don't want the sea to cry
a new rainstorm at my door...
All the eyes of the wind
already cry me as dead.
with my small happiness,
light happiness of knowing myself,
mind the hand that closes.
I don't want the sea to arrive
at the thirst of my poem,
blind in the middle of light,
broken in the middle of an absence.
I wanted to be like men wanted me to be:
an attempt at life;
a game of hide and seek with my being.
But I was made of nows,
and my feet level on the promissory earth
would not accept walking backwards
and went forward, forward,
mocking the ashes to reach the kiss
of new paths.
At each advancing step on my route forward
my back was ripped by the desperate flapping wings
of the old guard.
But the branch was unpinned forever,
and at each new whiplash my look
separated more and more and more from the distant
familiar horizons;
and my face took the expansion that came from within,
the defined expression that hinted at a feeling
of intimate liberation;
a feeling that surged
from the balance between my life
and the truth of the kiss of the new paths.
Already my course now set in the present,
I felt myself a blossom of all the soils of the earth,
of the soils without history,
of the soils without a future,
of the soil always soil without edges
of all the men and all the epochs.
And I was all in me as was life in me...
But I was made of nows;
when the heralds announced me
at the regal parade of the old guard,
the desire to follow men warped in me,
and the homage was left waiting for me.
Blessed who, one morning,
Suddenly
Turns aside from the road he used to walk each day,
For years, until the irrevocable
District of duty.
So what made him digress:
The ineffective sameness of inertia,
Taedium vitae repeatedly ongoing like a merciless
Devastation, the dampened
Distance between morons and their prisons?
Did he unwittingly choose the least
Predictable, thats to say, the fairest way?
Blessed he who one day decided to retrace his life
Until reaching one very unendorseable peace.
Theres a great white bird,
Nesting in the word time, a consecutive
Loss of past historic,
And some surplus of fleetingness.
Other words interweave
In the word time, of the same stock:
The slow, perpetual sea, and its fathomless
Wearing away, fate ever wandering,
And the astronomic light gap.
The one strategy best poised to defeat time
Is to be able to waste it, and go unpunished.
My body was there no one used it.
I put it to suffer I put a man inside of it.
But this sad horse-like matter
If it is hungry, it neighs verses to me,
If it dreams, he kicks me on the horizon;
I put it to discuss and liberate forests,
Only to me he appears when he kisses
I don't know what to do with this body of mine,
Someone rented it to me, I don't know when
They gave it to me naked, clean, tame,
It was innocent when I put it on myself,
But from time to time,
The reason it dirties me and the adorable thing
I want to return it like it was delivered to me;
Nevertheless,
I know that it is time that they gave it to me.
The restaurant is teeming.
While we eat
we recall
a certain divine intervention.
Two gods and a goddess
were required
to placate the Erinnyes.
He invoked them
with a gesture of entreaty.
They interceded
when the hunted man
stopped fleeing.
Three deities.
Without saying so
I think:
perhaps we
dont need so much.
To perceive
outside,
inside,
in and out,
to become
a recorder
—as though a stranger
had commissioned from us
a report—
is to live
as an amazed scribe.
Here the wind can be heard again.
It passes between the buildings, sways
the pines, freezes the drive-in.
You who are moving everywhere,
I cant tell you: Hear, O hear,
be thou spirit fierce my spirit.
In the night there is only
a waiting
but no one is impetuous enough to speak to you
as in the age of enthusiasm.
You are what you are, a solitary voice
resounding on the outskirts of cities.
The words they addressed to you passed too
like the dazzling leaves.
This is a different world, without direction.
The wind, when it lashes,
beats against chaos.
The great visitor of Ladies
retires.
Only one will fill his life,
canonised in advance by this conjunction.
The flesh has known no higher tribute.
The body, that great prince,
shone again in his words.
Your country, life,
awards no prizes.
It only
sustains you.
The more you belong to it,
the more foreign you are.
So, you stand firm
and say, theres one thing
I cant be wrong about:
my country of origin.
In the silence that falls
suddenly
when were talking
sometimes an angel passes,
sometimes a god passes
and sometimes
its a tyrant,
the owner of the house,
the lord within.
He never stops prowling
round our home.
One day
hell take over the door
and hell be the only visitor.
He wont let anyone in or out.
Hell settle with the keys
where we cant see him.
I'm alive.
To whom do I owe this honour?
My soul staggers. Dante accompanies me
through the Soviet night.
I wander through the ruins
of Hellas.
I can't flee.
Hide
the poems, Nadezhda.
Caesar, how could you
destroy
our liveliness?
I have abandoned all hope
at the entrance to the camp.
The only man who speaks Russian
couldnt forget.
A god forgives,
a demigod does not.
The shouts
are lost in the vastness of my country.
Things, more than people, knew...
Things, more than people, knew
his eyes on them
and opened up
to a different existence.
He received them transforming them
into what they were, returning them to their exactitude,
bathing them in their own gold,
for what does the yielding know
of its splendid state?
Stones, flowers, clouds
were reborn
in another silence
where time would pass differently.
His restful gaze
never went to them for a reason.
Only his eyes wanted.
Now they miss him;
people hurry by - where to?
Things
want to be lived.
The marital bond
can be
frenzy of the blood.
The painter thanks Helena Fourment
beyond life itself
for revealing
this jubilation to him.
She, the initiator, appears in the pictures
as she was seen by satiated, watching eyes.
If we look carefully
we will see the portrait of his first wife
chastised by a dryness;
but Helenas, instead,
bursts like a desire
out of the canvas.
Let us hallow that bed
where the pagan vein met reverent flesh.
Poets
raise
splendid edifices.
No roughness.
Only austerity.
Only the clean work.
Only the hidden splendour.
Theyre not deceiving themselves;
but it amazes me that they go on
working
on the house of language.
Messengers cover huge distances
sometimes not knowing what they are carrying.
Their lungs ensure communication
and people are wrong if they think
that job is a luxury.
How did you make yourself?
What law were you following?
What hands held you up?
Its so tough to be
there
exposed
without asking for anything
except
the deep dictate,
its overwhelming
gusts,
the voice
with no owner,
the sound
that belongs to no one.
She shines
in the thick vegetation.
I see her take in her hands
a piece of soft wood
still moist
and start to slowly carve a face
and leave it for the years to finish,
for it to be gentle like someone whos grateful
and firm in its way
and alert.
They say,
or rather, they half say.
They look after the grass
that the barbarians leave behind.
They wander vaguely through their rooms, but
they hold up the tower of the language.
Today poets
can only be
ironic.
Understatements,
contrasts,
paradoxes,
give them away.
The ancients
were different.
They had on their side
a god
or a goddess
if they had not fallen from
their always uncertain favour.
They repeated
aere perennius.
What pride!
They foresaw
nothing.
Now
they are faced with
the scorched earth order
(which is carried out
without fail),
the old start-over
and a blank
sheet.
The excess
of assenting,
the luxury of grasping not keeping
like hands that forget,
the modest speech
of the ready soul
—tremulous
occurrences—
sculpt us,
erect us,
undo us,
to lift us again
firmer
in spite of relapses,
straying,
distractions,
the usual diversions that you
knew how to evade
with iron gentleness,
immeasurable workman.
This living in suspense
holds me
without any sign
or map
or promise,
in an entrance-hall where everyone's on the run
as employees
to forget.
Many cities
you travelled,
on the fringes,
defenceless against enormity
and determined to behave
not like those on whose scales
name
weighs more than life,
but ignored,
like someone passing through in silence,
alert,
with no burdens,
who wants
to hear.
You persuade us
to hold out,
to free ourselves of all ties,
to live without resisting,
to stand up in this wind of pure existence,
to live with no promises in the drought.
It can happen after a hard struggle
that the poem
is where it was least expected to be,
where no one was looking for it,
where it cant be seen,
in the darkest corner.
It ended up there,
mocking the writer, the reader and the page.
It slipped away to that place
where suddenly
its discovered.
Here,
says a small voice.
Hidden
like a child
in a room
where old furniture is stored.
You held out in the front line alone.
No one has taken that road again.
You are the last.
Because it is hard
to persist,
hard to let oneself go,
hard to stand enormity,
hard not to belong to the shouting,
hard to hold on to language at its limits,
hard to be aware that words do not protect
and still do ones work, secretly, for no reason.
Did you know
within yourself
that poems are not enough?
Why should we,
the inadequate,
sculpt the word?
Do we hope to hear
by saying?
What do we seek
digging with it
in hardened earth?
Who can speak
unaware of being
a miracle?
Here, where fecundity of Babel frames
Stuff for all ills wherewith the world doth teem,
Where loyal Love is slurred with disesteem,
For Venus all controls, and all defames;
Where vice's vaunts are counted, virtue's shames;
Where Tyranny o'er Honor lords supreme;
Where blind and erring sovereignty doth deem
That God for deeds will be content with names;
Here in this world where whatso is, is wrong,
Where Birth and Worth and Wisdom begging go
To doors of Avarice and Villainy,--
Trammelled in the foul chaos, I prolong
My days, because I must. Woe to me! Woe!
Sion, had I not memory of thee!
No matter how content I be,
a pain is hidden in me
that I feel I know not where
born from I know not what.
I am grieved or content,
born into full hands,
for each joy one hundred griefs,
for each pain another hundred.
Into my mirror's glass I gaze
At forty years of age,
And find myself so worn with days
I break the glass in rage.
And then I turn my gaze and peer
Across my mirrored soul;
And see within my conscience clear
My woes beyond control.
The loss of faith, of love, of youth—
I see my mortal curse!—
Within my mirror—evil truth;
And in my conscience—worse!
I marked a cross upon a lonely spot
One day when in the country I took air;
A passer told me — "A base robber shot
And killed a soldier there".
O false tradition! — once again I passed
The site upon that lonely plain;
Another stranger told me, as the last—
"A robber here was by a soldier slain".
...
How many poems of love, sung in vain!
Oh, how old becomes my soul
when I recall the ancient
absurd story of yesterday.
How many poems of love, moaned in vain!
First you were a flower, I, the Bee.
Then my heart found in your window
the bitter snow that drove me old.
How many poems of love, lost in vain!
Today, my windows are wide open,
there is sunshine... many flowers, and it's summer...
But it's sad to see by my doorstep,
among so many dead butterflies,
so many poems of love cried in vain!...
Today arriving on Pichincha's slope,
The deadly cannon of the whites I flee,
Like the sun a wanderer, like the sun aflame,
Like the sun free.
O Sun, my Father, hearken! Manco's throne
Lies in the dust; Thy altar's sanctity
Profaned; exalting thee alone I pray,
Alone but free.
O Sun, my Father, hearken! A slave before
The nations of the world I'll not agree
To bear the mark. To slay myself I come,
To die though free.
Today Thou wilt perceive me, when afar
Thou dost begin to sink into the sea,
Singing Thy hymns on the volcano's top,
Singing and free.
Tomorrow though, alas! when once again
Thy crown throughout the east will shining be,
Its golden splendor on my tomb will fall,
My tomb though free.
Upon my tomb the condor will descend
From heaven, the condor, bird of liberty,
And building there its nest, will hatch its young,
Unknown and free.
Oblivion's misty prison ceased its moan
Before the Thracian youth; ceased too the lyre
Its consonance; the tears and fond desire
Ceased in their gentle sweetness to intone.
Sisiphus, at hearing, rests his stone;
And Tantalus might have eased his hunger dire
With that elusive apple, and no ire
Attend him from dread Radamanthus' Throne.
But see, Eurydice is passing through
The deeps of Orcus, oh, behold her doom!
They turn, he to his moan, she to her chains!
O Love, how good and ill are joined in you!
In one poor lover how could you presume
To give his voice such power,--his eyes such pains?
To think about you is blue, like wandering
through a golden forest in the middle of the day:
gardens are born from my words
and with my clouds, I walk through your dreams.
Unites us and separates on a soft air,
a distance of darkness;
I raise the arms of my poem,
blue from you, hurt and waiting.
It is like a horizon of violins
or the lukewarm suffering of a jasmine
to think about you, of blue temperament.
The world becomes glassy to me,
and I look at you, between the lamp of chirps,
blue Sunday of my thoughts.
I was born in the century of the death of the rose
when the motor had already driven out the angels.
Quito watched the last stagecoach roll,
and at its passing the trees ran by in good order,
and the hedges and houses of the new parishes,
on the threshold of the country
where slow cows were ruminating the silence
and the wind spurred its swift horses.
My mother, clothed in the setting sun,
put away her youth in a deep guitar,
and only on certain evenings would she show it to her children,
sheathed in music, light, and words.
I loved the water-writing of the rain,
the yellow gnats from the apple tree,
and the toads that would sound from time to time
their bulging wooden bells.
The great sail of the air maneuvered endlessly.
The mountain range was a shoreline of the sky.
The storm would come, and at the roll of its drum
its drenched regiments would charge;
but then the sun with its golden patrols
would bring back translucent peace to the fields.
I would watch men clasp the barley,
horsemen sink into the sky,
and the wagons filled with lowing oxen
go down to the coast fragrant with mangoes.
The valley was there with its farms
where dawn touched off its trickle of roosters,
and westward was the land where the sugarcane
rippled its peaceful banner, and the cacao
held close in a coffer its secret fortune,
and the pineapple girded on its fragrant cuirasse,
the naked banana its tunic of silk.
All has gone now, in sequent waves,
like the futile cyphers of the foam.
The years go leisurely entangling their lichens,
and memory is scarcely a water-lily
showing on the surface timidly
its drowned face.
The guitar is only a coffin for songs,
and die head-wounded cock laments.
All the angels of the earth have emigrated,
even the dark angel of the cacao tree.
On a bull's hollow horn
Juan blew the message that the barley was ready.
In their clay huts
the seven families
poured the sun-juice
into brown jars.
The hill squatted in'the field
wrapped in a plaid poncho.
Red, green, yellow dresses
began to climb the road.
Amid a riot of colours
the glowing barley sheaves went down with a swish,
decimated by the sickles.
Tomasa weighed the ripeness of the sky
in the scales of her sunflower arms.
The slow swing of the field
molded the shape of her waist.
Men and women of the seven families,
seated in the tender noon-day gold,
drank sun-juice
from the clay jars.
Fruit-vender church,
seated at a corner of life :
crystal oranges of windows.
Organ of sugarcane stalks.
Angels: chicks
of Mother Mary,
The little blue-eyed bell
runs out barefoot
to scamper over the countryside.
Clock of the Sun;
angelical donkey with its innocent sex;
handsome Sunday wind
bringing news from the hill ; \
Indian women with their vegetable-loads
bound to their foreheads.
The sky rolls up its eyes
when the little barefoot bell
comes scampering out of the church.
Against the huge black door o the night
twelve knocks resound.
Men sit up in their beds :
fear glides over them with icy scales.
Who can it be ? Through the houses
fear slips unsandalled.
Men see the flame of their lamps
blown out by the clamorous knocking:
the unknown guest is calling,
and a thin blue flame runs along their eyelids.
Clock:
Stonecutter of time.
It strikes the hardest wall of night.
Obdurate chisel, the pendulum.
The vanilla awakens,
And composes partitas of fragrance in the clothes closets.
Overseeing the work of the clock,
Silence goes about in its hushed slippers.
With the preserved fruit of your voice
the elevator's crystal cage
mounts to the fifth floor.
The subway train
bears the orange light of your skin
through wide tunnels.
The omnibus
scatters along the avenue its wheaten lashes
before the emerald sickle of your eyes.
A glass pamphlet, the revolving door
reveals your body's Ex-Libris
on the last page.
From the dark tower which is a ship's mast
the stroke of One
slips down through the night like the body of one drowned.
On the blackboard the stroke of One
inscribes its scrawl.
Glassy-eyed houses dive into the night.
Tails between their legs, the prowling dogs
howl at the stroke of One
as at a dead man.
RABBIT: timid brother! My teacher and philosopher!
Your life has taught me the lesson of silence.
For since in solitude you find your mine of gold,
the world's eternal onward march means nothing to you.
Tiny seeker after wisdom,
you leaf, as through a^book, the good and humble cabbage;
and like Saint Simeon, from your dark hole
you watch the evolutions of the swallows.
Ask your good God for a garden in Heaven,
a garden with crystal cabbages in glory,
a spring of fresh water for your tender nose,
and a flight of doves above your head.
You live in the odour of perfect sanctity.
The cincture of Father Saint Francis will touch you
on the day of your death. And in Heaven
the souls of children will play with your long ears!
Chimneys with widebrimmed hats,
twisted chimneys, parentheses of country
in the city, throats
through which the song of things mounts sadly:
the homely song of the kettle,
of the cricket and the hearth in the dark kitchen,
the song of the castered chair,
and even the monkish sound that doors make.
Hostile chimneys like weapons
of urban hatred against the singing blue!
Smoke above the roofs : silent gunfire
against the birds' celestial flight!
Bah! Mount up to the sky, aim at the sparrows,
leave the dark earth of men...
My soul too is a chimney
where burns the song of little lives,
a sooty chimney
that spits forth, day after day, a sad dense smoke
upon the white pages of the unpublished volume.
It rained in the night
there are pears on the ground.
Prostrate as abbesses
the cabbages lie round.
From, the bird at the window
there's all this to be heard.
Out here in the country
our newspaper's the bird.
Goodbye to worries!
Let's leave the lazy bed.
Rain has washed life as clean
as a cabbage-head.
The almond tree has bought herself a dress
to make her first communion, and sparrows
in doorways are advertising their green wares.
Now Spring has sold
all her white clothes, her January masks,
and busies herself today only with carrying
puffs of propaganda into every quarter.
Reeds of glass. Flasks of spilt perfume.
Flowered carpets laid for schoolchildren.
Small baskets. Forked poles
of the cherry trees. Over-size gloves
of the duck from the pond. Heron : flying parasol!
Typewriter of breeze in the leaves,
sweet-scented inventory.
Come, see the show-window of the night:
cross of diamonds, little red lanterns,
and a rosary of precious stones.
March has lighted its fires in the grass
and the useless old fir tree has put on green goggles.
Spring, within a few months, will make out
an order for jars of fruit conserve,
grapes —little bulbs of sweet crystal—,
and dry golden leaves in which to pack up distress.
I hear your familiar footsteps all about me,
your pace like a cloud's or a slow river's,
your presence making itself felt: your humble majesty
visiting me, subject of your eternal dominion.
Over a pale unforgettable time,
over green families prostrate on the ground,
over empty dresses and trunkfuls of weeping,
over a land of rain, you rule silently.
You walk in insects and in toadstools, your laws
are executed by my hand every day,
and your voice slips furtively through my mouth
softening the metal and ash of my voice.
Compass of my long earthly voyage.
Origin of my blood, source of my destiny.
When the featureless dust hid you in its lair
I woke astonished to find myself still alive.
And I tried to tear down the invisible doors,
and vainly, a prisoner, I prowled about them.
I hanged myself haplessly with a rope of sobs,
and calling on you, traversed the marshes of dream.
But you are here, living, all about me.
I am aware of you breathing gently
through those sweet things that gaze upon me
in heavenly order, ranged by your hand.
You inhabit the breadth of the morning sunlight
and with your accustomed care enfold me
in its weightless mantle of lofty light
still chilly with cocks and shadows.
You measure the liquid chirrup of insects and birds
making me a gift of the sweetness of earth,
and your tender signals keep guiding me,
my solitude filled with your hidden speech.
You are in all that I do, you inhabit my silence.
Yours is the mandate that stands at my shoulder
when night drinks up the colours
and your infinite presence fills hollow space,
I hear within me your prophetic words,
and throughout the vigil you companion me,
warning of things to come, incomprehensible keys,
births of stars, ages of the plants.
Dweller in the skies, live, live without years.
My original blood, my earliest light.
May your immortal life, breathing through all things
in vast simple chorus, surround and sustain me!
Corn hangs from the rafters
by its canary wings.
Little guinea-pigs
bewilder the illiterate silence
with sparrow twitter and dove coo.
There is a mute race through the hut
when the wind pushes against the door.
The angry mountain
raises its dark umbrella of cloud
lightning-ribbed.
Francisco, Martin, Juan
working in the farm on the hill
must have been caught by the storm,
A downpour of birds
falls chirping on the sown fields.
When things forget their form and their colour,
and, beset by night, the walls fold up,
and everything kneels or withdraws or is confused,
you alone stay erect, luminous presence.
Your clear resolution dominates the shadows,
in the darkness shimmers your mineral silence;
like sudden doves
you send your secret messages to things.
Every chair is elongated in the night and awaits
an unreal guest before a plate of shadow,
and only you, transparent witness,
repeat by rote a lesson of light.
In the high mystical night over the slept field
its pavilion of stars encircles the firmament:
vast liturgical veil dotted with silver
and gold on pale blurred blue background.
A musical silence boils around: noise
of the greedy urn of the ether, oh wonder!
on another mystical night even another listening ear
has lowered so now it can fill my ear.
Man you see, listen: it's not just to your eyes
a gift this hive of light, deep and calm.
Learn to hear the rhythm that wander among the orbs.
If you only see, what do you do on dark nights?
Learn to hear, and you will hear God in the heights
and you will enjoy the peace promised to the land.
More than a mother as a saint to me
You were in truth. You gave me birth and died,
But Oh! my mother when you left my side
God kissed an angel in eternity.
Today when in my dreams methinks I see
Your smiling face, I gaze on you with pride,
And sigh, sweet mother, as I oft have sighed
While tears I shed when I remember thee.
And should we never, never meet again
How sad twould be, but I shall always keep
Your image in my heart, and not complain;
For something tells me that you lie asleep
Because my suffring would have caused you pain
Because my weeping would have made you weep.
Why weepest thou, my sweetheart pale,
Why bendest down thy lovely head?—
A dread idea doth assail
My mind and turn my heart to lead.—
Tell me: have they not loved thee well?—
Never!— Come, tell the truth to me.—
Ah. then: one lover only 1 can tell
Was faithful.— Who?— My misery.
My loves are bronzes, crystals, porcelains,
Windows aglow like jewelled treasuries,
Hangings of florid, golden argosies,
And salvers brilliant with Venetian stains.
My loves are damosels of ancient reigns,
The old worlds troubadour sweet harmonies,
The steed that bounds to Arabic caprice.
The German ballad with its tear refrains,
Ihe ivory-carved piano-keys aflood,
The sounding horn within the forest glade.
the soft aroma from the censer fumed.
The couch of ivory, gold. and sandal-wood,
Where virgin loveliness at last is laid,
A broken flower of inocence entombed.
Only the voice, the skin and the scarfskin
of the silken things
Rein in. The music of the inner ear doesnt want more than its cave
he will overstretch the hand and will not reach the sound
to touch beyond.
Amused, slided, caressing
and slowly admit the contour.
He retire filled up
without realize the vain hoot
from the captivity of the bowels
nor the rush of the blood calmness
that assault the lock of gush, not the joint
already forever blind of sob.
The one that leaves takes the memory,
the way of being river, of being air,
of being goodbye and never.
Till one day another halt it, rein in
and reduces to voice, to skin, to scarfskin
offered, delivered, while inside
the hidden loneliness waits and shiver.
We kill that which we love. The rest 
was never alive. 
No one is as close to us. No other is so hurt 
by forgetfulness, an absence, a mere nothing. 
We kill that which we love. An end to the asphyxia 
of breathing with anothers lungs! 
The air isnt sufficient 
for the two of us, nor the earth 
for our bodies entwined. 
The dose of hope is small 
and sorrow cannot be shared. 
Man is made of solitudes, 
a deer in flight, bleeding, 
its loins pierced by an arrow. 
Ah, but hatred 
its insomniac fixity of glass: 
repose and menace combined. 
The deer inclines its head to drink, 
discovers a tigers image in the water. 
The deer drinks the water and its image. It becomes 
(before it is devoured —astonished accomplice—) 
equal to its enemy. 
We give life only to what we hate.
Boscán and Garcilaso having come
to that place where the troubadours reside,
who in our tongue and its exquisiteness
were in this century once recognized,
the two groups at each other in alarm
regard, the colors of their faces fade,
fearing that they might be foreign scouts
or spies or enemies gone renegade;
and judging them at first just by their clothes,
it seemed to them they were, as it should be,
two cultivated Spanish gentlemen;
and hearing the new language that they spoke,
all mixed with verse from lands across the sea,
they looked at them with eyes of aliens.
I love them—and I hearken
As the winds their notes prolong,
Like the murmur of a fountain,
Like a lambkin's distant song.
Like the birds serenely winging
On their way across the skies,
At the break of daylight soaring
To salute it with their cries.
In their voices saying ever
O'er the plain and mountain peak
Something that is frank and candid,
That a soothing charm would speak.
Should their voices cease forever,
What a sorrow for the air!
What a silence in the belfries!
And the dead--how strangely bare!
Far from the rhythm of the waves,
the moaning wind, 
from the flickering reflection that lights
the woods and clouds 
from the call of some passing bird,
from the unknown rural smell
that the zephyr steals
from valley or hill-top, 
there are worlds where peace can be found
by souls who are sinking
'neath the weight of the world.
Oh beauty that doth far transcend
All other beauty! Thou dost design.
Without a wound our hearts to pain
Without a pang our wills to bend
To hold all love for creatures vain.
O mystic love-knot that dost bind.
Two beings of such diverse kind.
How canst thou, the, e'er severed be?
For bound, such strength we gain from Thee,
We take for joys the griefs we find.
Things void of being linked, unite
With that great Beauty Infinite
Thou fill'st my soul, which hungers still:
Thou lov'st where men can find but ill
Our naught grows precious, by Thy might!
How blessed is the heart with love fast bound
With God the centre of every thought
Renouncing all created things as naught
In Him its glory and joy are found
Even from self, its cares are now set free
T'wards God alone it aims- its actions tend
Joyful and Swift it journeys to its end
O'er the wild waves of life's tempestuous seas.
Perhaps my feeble eyes will never see the south
with its evanescent landscapes sleeping in the air,
with bodies like flowers under shade of branches
or fleeing in a gallop of furious horses.
The south is a desert that cries as it sings,
and that voice does not fade like a dead bird;
but towards the sea guides its bitter desires
opening a weak echo that lives slowly.
Into that so-distant south I want to be infused.
There, the rain is a half-opened rose;
there, even the mist laughs, a white smile in the wind.
The souths darkness, its light, are equal beauties.
A man in grey walks the gloomy street.
Nobody suspects him. Hes a vacant body;
Vacant like the plain, the sea, the wind,
Such bitter deserts under an implacable sky.
Hes time past, and his wings
find a pallid force in darkness;
Hes remorse, who by night, secretly,
hestitantly, gathers in his neglected shadow.
Dont take that hand! Ivy creeps,
covering the winter branches.
Invisible, the grey man walks through the calm.
Dont you hear the dead? But the earth is deaf.
I swear to God such grandeur frightens me.
I'd pay good money to describe it well;
for whom would this great structure, all this wealth,
not hold in wonder with its awesome spell?
By Christ alive, each part of it is worth
more than a million; isn't it a shame
that it won't last a century - Great Seville! -
triumphant Rome in zeal and noble fame.
I'll bet the very soul of this here corpse
just to enjoy this spot today has quit
that heaven where he endlessly resides.
A braggart overheard these words and said:
"Oh, Mr. soldier, what you say is true.
And anyone who says it's not, he lies."
And then, quite suddenly,
he checked his sword with care, pulled down his hat,
he looked away, moved on, and that was that.
As shepherds find delight in leafy shade
or in fresh breezes during dog-day heat;
as when their thirsty flocks are overjoyed
to find a fount of water pure and sweet;
so my tree, when on its fragile bark
my name is symbolized or written plain,
rejoices. God of Love, keep safe this tree
so that the name may live eternally!.
And yet my icy heart will not dissolve
however much, Vandalio, you may burn;
I am no melting snow neath Phoebus' rays!
Thus spoke proud Dorida as in the stream
she gazed upon her beauty, but her voice,
snatched by the wind, grew fainter than a dream.
Amidst the arms, war, fire, fury and rage
which have the haughty Frenchman so oppressed,
and when the air is most confused and thick,
there by love's fiercest fires am I enclosed.
I look up at the sky, the trees, the flowers,
and in them find my suffering expressed;
for on the coldest, most inclement day
sprout fresh and turn to green again my woes.
I say aloud, in tears: "Oh springtime sweet,
when will it be that I might see my hope,
all green, some real peace in my soul inspire?"
But I fear that my cruel fate my death
will mandate when I'm so far from my love,
Amidst the war, rage, fury, arms, and fire.
To see if her eyes really did deserve
the reputation local shepherds spread,
regarding them in a clear pool one day
Dorida saw that it was true, and said:
Oh eyes, whose beauty makes me confident
of deathless fame among our mortal kind,
what treasured good, if vanished from the world,
could match the grievious ills you leave behind?
I deemed, before I looked at you, how rash
those mad and love-struck shepherds all must be
who dared to to call themselves your vanquish'd slaves!
But, seeing now so many charms in you,
I deem those to be maddest and most lost
whom love did not at once drive to their graves.
A huge trunk stranded where the river flows
Lies the strong alligator in our sight,—
Spine like a mountain chain of rugged height,
Abysmal jaws, a mighty tail for blows.
Round him the sunlight like a halo glows;
He seems encased in shining armor bright—
A metal monster that reflects the light,
And, as it glitters, changeful color shows.
Motionless like an idol, girt around
With strong steel mail, he lies upon the shore,
In gloomy ecstasy reposing there,
Like to a prince by some enchantment bound,
Condemned to dwell a prisoner evermore
Within a river's crystal palace fair.
Freaks of bright crystal, airy beauties
Whose enigmatic forms amaze the eye—
Crowns fit to deck Apollo's brows on high,
Adornments meet for halls of splendor rare!
They spring from knots in tree-trunks, rising there
In sweet gradation; winding wondrously,
They twist their serpent stems, and far and nigh
Hang overhead like wingless birds in air.
Lonely, like pensive heads, all fetterless,
Lofty and free they bloom; by no dull chain
Their flowers to any tyrant root are bound;
Because, they too, at war with pettiness,
Desire to live, like souls that know no stain,
Without one touch of contact with the ground.
Between my aged mother's hands gleam bright
Her grandson's locks; they seem a handful fair
Of wheat, a golden sheaf beyond compare—
The sun's gold, stolen from the dawn's clear light.
Meanwhile her own white tresses in my sight
Shed brightness all around her in the air—
Foam of Time's wave, a sacred glory rare,
Like spotless eucharistic wafers white.
O flood of gold and silver, full and free!
You make my heart with gladness overrun.
If hatred barks at me, what need I care?
To light my days and nights, where'er I be,
In my child's curls I always have the sun,
The moon in my dear mother's silver hair!
She moves the air, her own gentleness
returns to fire: the cold
to amazement and the splendor
arises to music. No one
breathes, nobody thinks and only
the undulation of the glances
shimmers like hair a comet trails.
In the drawing room the marble sobs
its propriety recovered, the river
of ashes groans and hides
faces and clothes and humidity.
Body of happening or peak
in motion, its epitaph
prevails in the half-light and forsakes
collapsing, untumultuous waves.
Lifeless in ignominy, in space
the families doze, sad
as the imprisoned gambles,
and the adultress longs for
the charity of another's sheer.
Under the light, the dancer
dreams of disappearing.
Autumn surrounds the valley, iniquity
overflows, and the hill sacred to splendor
responds in the form of a revenge. The dust measures
and misfortune knows who gallops
where all gallop with the same fury:
constrained attendance on the broken circle
by the son who startles his father gazing
from a window buried in the sand.
Blood of mans victim
besieges doors, cries our: "Here no one lives,"
but the mansion is inhabited by the barbarian who seeks
dignity, yoke of the fatherland
broken, abhorred by memory,
as the husband looks at his wife face to face
and close to the threshold, the intruder
hastens the trembling that precedes misfortune.
Iron and greed, a decisive leprosy
of hatreds that were fed by rapine and deceits
wets the seeds. Brother against brother
comes to the challenge without pity
brings to a pause its stigma against the kingdom of pity:
arrogance goads the leap into the void
that as the wind dies the eagles abandon
their quest like tumbled statues.
Emptied upon the mockery of the crowd
the afternoon defends itself, redoubles its hide
against stones that have lost their foundations.
Her offense is compassion when we pass
from the gilded alcove to the somber one
with the fixety of glowing coals: hardly
a moment, peaceful light as upon
a drunken soldier awaiting his degradation.
We can smile later at our childish furies
giving way to rancor and sometimes envy
before the ruffian who without a word taking leave
descends from the beast
in search of surcease. The play is his:
mask quitting the scene, catastrophy
overtaking love with its delirium and with delight
looses the last remnant of its fury.
Came doubt and the lust for wine,
bodies like daggers, that transform
youth to tyranny: pleasures
and the crew of sin.
A bursting rain of dishonor
a heavy tumult and the nearnesses
were disregarded drums and cries and sobs
to those whom no one calls by the name of "brother".
At last I thought the day calmed
its own profanities. The clouds, contempt,
the site made thunderbolts by loves phrases,
tableware, oil, sweet odors, was all
a cunning propitiation of the enemy,
and I discovered later floating over
the drowned tribes, links of foam tumbling
blindly against the sides of a ship.
I open the door, return to the familiar mercy
of my own house where a vague
sense protects me the son who never was
smacking of shipwreck, waves or a passionate cloak
whose acid summers
cloud the fading face. Archaic refuge
of dead gods fills the region,
and below, the wind breathes, a conscious
gust which fanned my forehead yesterday
still sought in the perturbed present.
I could not speak of sheets, candles, smoke
nor humility and compassion, calm
at the afternoons edges, I could not
say "her hands," "her sadness," "our country"
because everything in her name
is lighted by her wounds. Like a signal sprung
of foam, an epitaph, curtains, a bed, rugs
and destruction moving toward disdain
while the lime triumphs denying her nakedness
the color of emptiness.
Now time, begins, the bitter smile
of the guest who in sleeplessness sings,
waking his anger, within the vile city
the calcined music with curled lip
from indecision
that flows without cease. Star or dolphin, yonder
beneath the wave his foot vanishes,
tunics turned to emblems
sink their burning shows and with ashes
score my own forehead.
Evil paid us a visit today,
Yet we decided to be welcoming hosts,
As we would to a generous guest.
Burst in evil did, at once like a snare or poison,
And open we threw
The door of our house.
As always, evil
Came blind, stark naked, unawares,
Sending dogs and cats running away,
But we still greeted him calmly
And showed him the way to the garden.
Over there, the day so sweet, in the scorching sun,
Sores and sorrows were searing,
Blotting blood off the wounds,
Canceling out the stench in the air.
Burst in evil did, like an irate blade,
In the vaults of shadows,
But open are our home and heart.
Once again, we had to put in love
Where no love had been before.
Done with the gag, spike, needle, bile
All smelted in the autumnal, musical bonfire
Unfurling today across the mountains.
I briefly went back inside
To offer the irascible guest
Some bread and drink.
My aim was to cheer him up,
And warm his frosty face.
Serene, back in the garden I went
Resolved to embrace evil, yet I couldnt,
For I found him shattered, a dying man
Collapsing from light and silence on the grass.
Today, evil paid us a visit,
But soon we had to bury him
Under an orange tree enveloped in fragrance,
Where bees hum tirelessly.
We had to drink alone
The wine we brought out for the guest,
The sweet wine of the deepest oblivion.
I know them, those horrible women, the knitters wrapped in fuzz,
in colors that grow from the hands of the yarn
into the trembling curd that moves under the network of eager fingers.
Daughters of the siesta, pale slugs hidden from the sun,
in any courtyard with clay pots their poison spreads, and their patience,
on twilight terraces, on neighborhood sidewalks,
in spaces polluted with car horns and radio moans,
in every hollow where time is turned into a pullover.
Knit, green woman, damp woman, knit, knit,
pile up that perishable stuff in the lap of the skirt your children sprang from,
that slow way of life, that oil of offices and universities,
that Sunday afternoon passion in the grandstands.
I know they knit at night, at secret times, they get out of bed
and knit in silence, in darkness; Ive stayed in hotels
where every dark room was a knitter, a gray
or white sleeve slipping out under the door; and they knit in banks,
they knit in bathrooms behind misty windows, and
in cold beds they knit with their backs to their snoring husbands.
They knit oblivion, stupidity and tears,
they knit, night and day they knit the inner clothes, they knit the bag where 
the heart is mothered,
they knit red bells and purple gloves to wrap around our knees,
and our voice is the ball of yarn for your knitted web, spider love, and this weariness
covers us, dresses the soul in a knit-purl-knit Santa Clara chain stitch,
death is a colorless web and youre knitting it for us.
Here they come, theyre coming—monsters with soft names, knitters,
hardworking women of the nations homes, office workers, kept
blondes, pale young nuns. Sailors knit,
sick old ladies hidden behind screens knit for their insomnia,
huge frayed fringes of knitting fly out of skyscrapers, the city
is tangled in yarn like strands of green and violet vomit.
Now theyre here, now theyre getting up without a word,
only their hands where gleaming needles flash,
and they have hands in their faces, hands coming out of their breasts, theyre
centipedes theyre centihands knitting in an insufferable silence
of tangos and speeches.
To JosÃ© Luis Aranguren
You hail from the saltpeter section,
torn away from it by winds and knives,
flesh paintful with nettle and bite,
fallen like the fruit of sin.
Frightened shadows, obstructed
continually by the rising sun;
continually defeated and continually
afflicted by heaven-borne panics.
As you are born, you cry out; you seek in vain
the roots of your blood, the dark hollow,
moist and faithful from which the star emerged
that I fastened for you on the cindery air.
I observe you in silence, reflected
in the pale puddles that the rain
feeds in the neglected streets;
biting harshly on your names.
Hollow beings fed by bitter bread,
dirty rejects of the immense sea,
what memories support your rotting
foundations in the sand?
Are they dreams of rooms of marble and mirrors,
of pale roses and rime-frost music? 
Or the golden mist of the dawn
stirring amid silk and emeralds?
It's hard to know if the air hurts you
when, with a tiger's voice, it roars louder and louder,
It's hard to know if your eyes
contain sulphur or fire—or only tears.
It's hard to touch with the fingertips
a heart full of fear or tenderness;
it's hard to know anything... because you are poor,
and the poor are a bottomless pit.
Why don't you understand that lean people exist
who make poetry and music, who weave
fantasies of gold for their children
and uninhabitable castles out of mist?
Why don't you understand the beauty of a dawn
made of electric light and violins,
and crisp as if starched, and with mosaics
guarded by stiff-necked duchesses?
Why don't you know how to clink fragile glasses
brimming over with wine and with rhetoric.
and the sharp savor of the fish
that come from the old Volga or the Blue Danube?
You only know how to say in your rough voices
that you are hungry or cold, and in the interludes
of a barbaric rhythm you swing and rock,
until you forget in sleep that you are men.
The only flower you know is the yelos
torn from the flesh; the only dawn,
the cruel and desolate remoteness
of the high firmament that punishes you.
You know no wine but blood,
no food but dry bread
gnawed and worried at, like a dog
beset by children with stones.
You live without Springtime in a damp
world dark with bluish mud; 
your poor hearts in shreds
recoil silently from the snow.
You hail from the saltpeter regions,
from the bitterest climate,
of the purest, deepest silence
the silence of the unloved man.
You are like a thick rainfall, striking
the broken bronze of a great bell
suspended from the trees in the middle of
a brown and lonely field.
And so I try with my verses to crown you
with incongruous laurels
on this liturgical day in March
transparent as an immense affliction.
And I kiss the eyes of diamond,
the lips of ravaged earth;
and I offer myself to your hunger
like a loaf of bread miraculously multiplied.
Because you seek in vain the roots
of your dark death, I would like
to flood you with dawn or with blood,
or to plow your bare soil, like a star.
Because you came in the bitterest silence,
I cry out to heaven, Oh blessed
are the poor, for they will possess the rose,
when the earth expires like a fading echo.
You shine in the skin
of bulls, in the girl's
ankles, in the
vague waves of water of
the meadow's stream,
and you shine
in ash, in whitewashed
walls.
You shine in darkness.
What god are you? Or perhaps
you are a goddess? Or neither?
I want to see
your deep eyes or your tall
breasts, but my eyes,
in which you shine the most,
prevent me from taking you by surprise.
I know a road which opens up before me
in the plains, the invisible mountains
of the air.
Trees undreamed of go with it
and give it shade. I have loved it
and feel disinclined
to be its pilgrim, for, to what Rome
will it take me, to what cherished land
beyond desire?
Near it there runs a river
and already the water reaches
my chest: it is transparent
yet lethal. And, while there is time,
I could reach its bank
and take
the road I perhaps have opened.
Through the mountains
and the plains of air
I see, among the clouds and birds,
edging round depths of light,
that road the gods
have denied themselves and now offer me.
(Tuscan museum)
Their beauty was such, they vanquished
stone and bronze,
disturbing the panels,
the canvas, the wall,
imprinting upon them
their fragance of body
and spirit, which now
catches our throats
like a fierce perfume.
They were fragile — but strong
in love — and gentle,
these women — Romans,
Venetians, Florentines,
blondes from Milan — and had
long secret pacts with time
and love, which now they offer
to us who did not exist then.
O living flame of love
that tenderly wounds my soul
in its deepest center! Since
now you are not oppressive,
now consummate! if it be your will:
tear through the veil of this sweet encounter!
O sweet cautery,
O delightful wound!
O gentle hand! O delicate touch
that tastes of eternal life
and pays every debt!
In killing you changed death to life.
O lamps of fire!
in whose splendors
the deep caverns of feeling,
once obscure and blind,
now give forth, so rarely, so exquisitely,
both warmth and light to their Beloved.
How gently and lovingly
you wake in my heart,
where in secret you dwell alone;
and in your sweet breathing,
filled with good and glory,
how tenderly you swell my heart with love.
One dark night,
fired with love's urgent longings
—ah, the sheer grace!—
I went out unseen,
my house being now all stilled.
In darkness, and secure,
by the secret ladder, disguised,
in darkness and concealment,
On that glad night,
in secret, for no one saw me,
nor did I look at anything,
with no other light or guide
than the one that burned in my heart.
This guided me
more surely than the light of noon
to where he was awaiting me
—him I knew so well—
there in a place where no one appeared.
O guiding night!
O night more lovely than the dawn!
O night that has united
the Lover with his beloved,
transforming the beloved in her Lover.
Upon my flowering breast
which I kept wholly for him alone,
there he lay sleeping,
and I caressing him
there in a breeze from the fanning cedars.
When the breeze blew from the turret,
as I parted his hair,
it wounded my neck
with its gentle hand,
suspending all my senses.
I abandoned and forgot myself,
laying my face on my Beloved;
all things ceased; I went out from myself,
leaving my cares
forgotten among the lilies.
A lone young shepherd lived in pain
withdrawn from pleasure and contentment,
his thoughts fixed on a shepherd-girl
his heart an open wound with love.
He weeps, but not from the wound of love,
there is no pain in such affliction,
even though the heart is pierced;
he weeps in knowing he's been forgotten.
That one thought: his shining one
has forgotten him, is such great pain
that he bows to brutal handling in a foreign land,
The shepherd says: I pity the one
who draws herself back from my love,
and does not seek the joy of my presence,
though my heart is an open wound with love for her.
After a long time he climbed a tree,
and spread his shining arms,
and hung by them, and died,
Not for all of beauty
will I ever lose myself,
but for I-don't-know-what
which is so gladly gained. 
Delight in the world's good things
at the very most
can only tire the appetite
and spoil the palate;
and so, not for all of sweetness
which is so gladly found. 
The generous heart
never delays with easy things
but eagerly goes on
to things more difficult.
Nothing satisfies it,
and its faith ascends so high
that it tastes I-don't-know-what
He who is sick with love,
whom God himself has touched,
finds his tastes so changed
that they fall away
like a fevered man's
who loathes any food he sees
and desires I-don't know-what
Do not wonder
that the taste should be left like this,
for the cause of this sickness
differs from all others;
and so he is withdrawn
from all creatures,
and tastes I-don't-know-what
For when once the will
is touched by God himself,
it cannot find contentment
except in the Divinity;
but since his Beauty is open
to faith alone, the will
tastes him in I-don't-know-what
Tell me, then, would you pity
a person so in love,
who takes no delight
in all creation;
alone, mind empty of form and figure,
finding no support or foothold,
he tastes there I-don't-know-what
Do not think that he who lives
the so-precious inner life
finds joy and gladness
in the sweetness of the earth;
but there beyond all beauty
and what is and will be and was,
he tastes I-don't-know-what
Whoever seeks to advance
takes much more care
in what he has yet to gain
than in what he has already gained;
and so I will always tend
toward greater heights;
beyond all things, to I-don't-know- what
I will never lose myself
for that which the senses
can take in here,
nor for all the mind can hold,
no matter how lofty,
nor for grace or beauty,
but only for I-don't-know-what
which is so gladly found.
Without support yet with support,
living without light, in darkness,
I am wholly being consumed.
My soul is disentangled
from every created thing
and lifted above itself
in a life of gladness
supported only in God.
So now it can be said
that I most value this:
My soul now sees itself
without support yet with support.
And though I suffer darknesses
in this mortal life,
that is not so hard a thing;
for even if I have no light
I have the life of heaven.
For the blinder love is
the more it gives such life,
holding the soul surrendered,
living without light in darkness.
After I have known it
love works so in me
that whether things go well or badly
love turns them to one sweetness
transforming the soul in itself.
And so in its delighting flame
which I am feeling within me,
swiftly, with nothing spared,
By the rivers
of Babylon
I sat down weeping,
there on the ground.
And remembering you,
O Zion, whom I loved,
in that sweet memory
I wept even more.
I took off my feastday clothes
and put on my working ones;
I hung on the green willows
all the joy I had in song,
putting it aside for that
which I hoped for in you.
There love wounded me
and took away my heart.
I begged love to kill me
since it had so wounded me;
I threw myself in its fire
knowing it burned,
excusing now the young bird
that would die in the fire.
I was dying in myself,
breathing in you alone.
I died within myself for you
and for you I revived,
because the memory of you
gave life and took it away.
The strangers among whom
I was captive rejoiced;
they asked me to sing
what I sang in Zion:
Sing us a song from Zion,
let's hear how it sounds.
I said: How can I sing,
in a strange land where I weep
for Zion, sing of the happiness
that I had there?
I would be forgetting her
if I rejoiced in a strange land.
May the tongue I speak with
cling to my palate
if I forget you
in this land where I am.
Zion, by the green branches
Babylon holds out to me,
may my right hand be forgotten
(that I so loved when home in you)
if I do not remember you,
my greatest joy,
or celebrate one feastday,
or feast at all without you.
O Daughter of Babylon,
miserable and wretched!
Blessed is he
in whom I have trusted,
for he will punish you
as you have me;
and he will gather his little ones
and me, who wept because of you,
at the rock who is Christ
for whom I abandoned you.
Debetur soli gloria vera Deo
Disillusionment,
this is the bitter end,
this proves you're rightly called
the end of illusion.
You've made me lose all,
yet no, losing all
is not paying too dear
for being undeceived.
No more will you envy
the allurements of love,
for one undeceived
has no risk left to run.
It's some consolation
to be expecting none:
there's relief to be found
in seeking no cure.
In loss itself
I find assuagement:
having lost the treasure,
I've nothing to fear.
Having nothing to lose
brings peace of mind:
one traveling without funds
need not fear thieves.
Liberty itself
for me is no boon:
if I hold it such,
it will soon be my bane.
No more worries for me
over boons so uncertain:
I will own my very soul
as if it were not mine.
My divine Lysis:
do forgive my daring,
if so I address you,
unworthy though I am to be known as yours.
I cannot think it bold
to call you so, well knowing
you've ample thunderbolts
to shatter any overweening of mine.
It's the tongue that misspeaks
when what is called dominion—
I mean, the master's rule—
is made to seem possession by the slave.
The vassal says: my king;
my prison, the convict says;
and any humble slave
will call the master his without offense.
Thus, when I call you mine,
it's not that I expect
you'll be considered such—
only that I hope I may be yours.
I saw you-need more be said?
To broadcast a fire,
telling the cause suffices—
no need to apportion blame for the effect.
Seeing you so exalted
does not prevent my daring;
no god is ever secure
against the lofty flight of human thought.
There are women more deserving,
yet in distance from heaven
the humblest of valleys
seems no farther than the highest peak.
In sum, I must admit
to the crime of adoring you;
should you wish to punish me,
the very punishment will be reward.
I approach, and I withdraw:
who but I could find
absence in the eyes,
presence in what's far?
From the scorn of Phyllis,
now, alas, I must depart.
One is indeed unhappy
who misses even scorn!
So caring is my love
that my present distress
minds hard-heartedness less
than the thought of its loss.
Leaving, I lose more
than what is merely mine:
in Phyllis, never mine,
I lose what can't be lost.
Oh, pity the poor person
who aroused such kind disdain
that to avoid giving pain,
it would grant no favor!
For, seeing in my future
obligatory exile,
she disdained me the more,
that the loss might be less.
Oh, where did you discover
so neat a tactic, Phyllis:
denying to disdain
the garb of affection?
To live unobserved
by your eyes, I now go
where never pain of mine
need flatter your disdain.
My lady, I must implore
forgiveness for keeping still,
if what I meant as tribute
ran contrary to your will.
Please do not reproach me
if the course I have maintained
in the eagerness of my love
left my silence unexplained.
I love you with so much passion,
neither rudeness nor neglect
can explain why I tied my tongue,
yet left my heart unchecked.
The matter to me was simple:
love for you was so strong,
I could see you in my soul
and talk to you all day long.
With this idea in mind,
I lived in utter delight,
pretending my subterfuge
found favor in your sight.
In this strange, ingenious fashion,
I allowed the hope to be mine
that I still might see as human
what I really conceived as divine.
Oh, how mad I became
in my blissful love of you,
for even though feigned, your favor
made all my madness seem true!
How unwisely my ardent love,
which your glorious sun inflamed,
sought to feed upon your brightness,
though the risk of your fire was plain!
Forgive me if, thus emboldened,
I made bold with that sacred fire:
there's no sanctuary secure
when thought's transgressions conspire.
Thus it was I kept indulging
these foolhardy hopes of mine,
enjoying within myself
a happiness sublime.
But now, at your solemn bidding,
this silence I herewith suspend,
for your summons unlocks in me
a respect no time can end.
And, although loving your beauty
is a crime beyond repair,
rather the crime be chastised
than my fervor cease to dare.
With this confession in hand,
I pray, be less stern with me.
Do not condemn to distress
one who fancied bliss so free.
If you blame me for disrespect,
remember, you gave me leave;
thus, if obedience was wrong,
your commanding must be my reprieve.
Let my love be ever doomed
if guilty in its intent,
for loving you is a crime
of which I will never repent.
This much I descry in my feelings
and more that I cannot explain;
but you, from what I've not said,
may infer what words won't contain.
Let them die with you, Laura, now you are dead,
these longings that go out to you in vain,
these eyes on whom you once bestowed
a lovely light never to gleam again.
Let this unfortunate lyre that echoes still
to sounds you woke, perish calling your name,
and may these clumsy scribblings represent
black tears my pen has shed to ease its pain.
Let Death himself feel pity, and regret
that, bound by his own law, he could not spare you,
and Love lament the bitter circumstance
that if once, in his desire for pleasure,
he wished for eyes that they might feast on you,
now weeping is all those eyes could ever do.
Phyllis, a brush's boldness
emboldens my feather-pen:
that brush's glorious failure
engenders hope, not fear.
Risking error in your cause
sufficed to spur me on.
When risk becomes so precious,
what value has mere success?
So do allow this quill
to risk another flight,
since, having offended once,
it otherwise has no leave.
You, O exquisite Phyllis,
such a heavenly creature,
grace's gift to the world,
heaven's very perfection.
On your most hallowed altars
no Sheban gums are burnt,
no human blood is spilt,
no throat of beast is slit,
for even warring desires
within the human breast
are a sacrifice unclean,
a tie to things material,
and only when the soul
is afire with holiness
does sacrifice glow pure,
is adoration mute.
I, my dearest Phyllis,
who revere you as divine,
who idolize your disdain,
and venerate your rigor;
I, like the hapless lover
who, blindly circling and circling,
on reaching the glowing core,
falls victim to the flame;
I, like the innocent child,
who, lured by the flashing steel,
rashly runs a finger
along the knife-blade's edge;
who, despite the cut he suffers,
is ignorant of the source
and protests giving it up
more than he minds the pain;
I, like adoring Clytie,
gaze fixed on golden Apollo,
who would teach him how to shine—
teach the father of brightness!
I, like air filling a vacuum,
like fire feeding on matter,
like rocks plummeting earthward,
like the will set on a goal-
in short, as all things in Nature,
moved by a will to endure,
are drawn together by love
in closely knit embrace ...
But, Phyllis, why go on?
For yourself alone I love you.
Considering your merits,
what more is there to say?
That you're a woman far away
is no hindrance to my love:
for the soul, as you well know,
distance and sex don't count.
How could I fail to love you,
once I found you divine?
Can a cause fail to bring results,
capacity go unfulfilled?
Since you are the acme of beauty,
the height of all that's sublime—
that Time's green axle-tree
beholds in its endless turning—
can you wonder my love sought you out?
Why need I stress that I'm true,
when every one of your features
betokens my enslavement?
Turn your eyes toward yourself
and you'll find in yourself and in them
not only occasion for love
but compulsion to surrender.
Meanwhile my tender care
bears witness I only live
to gaze at you spellbound and sigh,
to prove that for you I die.
I like when you say silly things,
when you mess up, when you lie,
when you go shopping with your mother
and Im late to the movies because of you.
I like you more when its my birthday
and you cover me with kisses and cakes,
or when you are happy and it shows,
or when youre great with a phrase
that sums it up, or when you laugh
(your laughter is a shower in hell)
or when youll excuse me for forgetting something.
But still, I like you more, so that
I can hardly resist what I like you
when you, so alive, you wake up
and the first thing you do is say,
I have a ferocious hunger this morning.
I am going start you with you my breakfast
I wanted to talk about life in all the corners
filled with song I wanted to join a river of words
the dreams and the names what is not said
in the newspapers the agony of the lonely
caught in the folds of the rain
reclaim the bare parables of the lovers and leave them
at the feet of a child's game
elaborating their sweet daily destruction
I wanted to pronounce the syllables of the people
the songs of their anguish
point out where the heart is lame
to say who alone deserves a shot
in the back to tell of my own country
lay down the exodus of the large
migrations that opened all the paths of the world
of love even dragged over there
by the ditches to talk to you about trains
and my friend who killed himself with another's knife
of the history of all of the people torn
from the blindness of the myth of reefs
the century that will end with my three sons
of the tongues of the birds and the furious foam
of the great quadrupeds' stampede
and I wanted to tell you about the Revolution
and about Cuba and the Soviet Union
and about the woman I love because of her eyes
of the smallest storms
and of your lives filled with sunrise
and asking people who saw it who said that
how could it be done I got here
ahead of you
and of all of the things of nature
and of the heart and its testimony
of the last fingerprint before annihilation
of the little animals and of tenderness
I wanted to say yes all that and tell
a lot of the stories I know and were told to me in my time
and all that I learned living in sorrow's big room
the things that were said by the poets before me
and that it was good to know
And I could not give you moreclosed door
of poetry
than my own headless body in the sand of the ring.
It is with the voice of the Bible, or the verse of Walt Whitman,
that I should come to you, Hunter,
primitive and modern, simple and complicated,
with something of Washington and more of Nimrod.
You are the United States,
you are the future invader
of the naive America that has Indian blood,
that still prays to Jesus Christ and still speaks Spanish.
You are the proud and strong exemplar of your race;
you are cultured, you are skillful; you oppose Tolstoy.
And breaking horses, or murdering tigers,
you are an Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar.
(You are a professor of Energy
as today's madmen say.)
You think that life is fire,
that progress is eruption,
that wherever you shoot
you hit the future.
The United States is potent and great.
When you shake there is a deep tremblor
that passes through the enormous vertebrae of the Andes.
If you clamor, it is heard like the roaring of a lion.
Hugo already said it to Grant: The stars are yours. v
(The Argentine sun, ascending, barely shines,
and the Chilean star rises...) You are rich.
You join the cult of Hercules to the cult of Mammon,
and illuminating the road of easy conquest,
Liberty raises its torch in New York.
But our America, that has had poets
since the ancient times of Netzahualcoyotl,
that has walked in the footprints of great Bacchus
who learned Pan's alphabet at once;
that consulted the stars, that knew Atlantis
whose resounding name comes to us from Plato,
that since the remote times of its life
has lived on light, on fire, on perfume, on love,
America of the great Montezuma, of the Inca,
the fragrant America of Christopher Columbus,
Catholic America, Spanish America,
the America in which noble Cuahtemoc said:
"I'm not in a bed of roses"; that America
that trembles in hurricanes and lives on love,
it lives, you men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul.
And it dreams. And it loves, and it vibrates, and it is the daughter of the Sun.
Be careful. Viva Spanish America!
There are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion.
Roosevelt, one would have to be, through God himself,
the-fearful Rifleman and strong Hunter,
to manage to grab us in your iron claws.
And, although you count on everything, you lack one thing: God!
To Gregorio Martínez Sierra
Days of youth, my sacred treasure,
Unreturning ye pass by!—
Would I weep?—no tears I measure;—
Then my tears—I know not why!—
My poor heart hath been divided
In its days celestial here;
There was a gentle maid, unguided
Through this world's affliction drear;
Like the white dawn was her vision;
Like the flower her gentle smile;
And her dusky locks elysian
Seemed of night and grief the style.
I was but a lad unknowing,—
She, as natural, would play
Through my love's fond ermine, showing
Herodias and Salomé.
Then my tears,—I know not why!—
There was another then, more tender,
More sensitive, more subtly kind,
More soothing, more delight to render
Than ever I had thought to find;
But 'neath her gentleness unceasing
A violent passion was concealed
And through her filmy robe releasing,
A wild Bacchante was revealed.
To breast she took my young ideal,
And nursed it softly as a child;
Then slew it, left it sad, unreal,
Of all its light and trust defiled.
There was another took my kisses
To be the casket of her flame;
She laughed amid our wildest blisses,—
Her teeth against my heart-strings came!
Amid the maddest of her passion
She looked across with wilful eyes,—
As though our fond embrace could fashion
The essence of eternal skies;
As though our fragile flesh were tying
The boughs of endless Edens here;
Unmindful that with Springtime dying
The joys of body disappear.
And all the others! In how many
Lands and climes,—they ever were!
Pretexts for a rhyme,—or any
Notion in my heart astir!—
Vain my search for that high lady
For whom I have awaited long.
But life is hard and grim and shady,—
There was no princess, save in song!
In spite of Time's unyielding measure,
My thirst for love has never died,—
My gray head bends to scent with pleasure
The roses of the garden-side—
Would I weep—no tears I measure;—
Mine is still the Dawn of golden treasure!—
The swan composed of snow floats in shadow,
amber beak translucent in the last light.
The white and innocent wings in the glow
of the short-lived dusk are rose-tipped and bright.
And then, on ripples of the clear blue lake,
when the crimson dawn is over and done,
the swan spreads his wings and lets his neck make
an arch, silver and burnished by the sun.
Grand, as he ruffles his silken feathers,
this bird from Olympus bearing loves wound,
ravishing Leda in roiling waters,
thrusting at petals of her sex in bloom...
When at last her sobbing is heard no more,
the stripped, mastered beauty lets out a sigh.
From some tangled green rushes by the shore,
sparkle-eyed Pan watches and wonders why.
For René Pérez
Happy the tree that can searcely feel,
and happier the hard stone because it does not feel at all,
for there is no greater grief than the grief of being alive,
and no greater affliction than conscious life.
To be and to know nothing, and to have no fixed course,
and the fear of what was and a terror of the future...
and the certain terror of being dead tomorrow,
and to suffer for life and the shadow (of death)
and for what we do not know and hardly suspect,
and for the flesh that tempts with its fresh grapes
and the tomb that waits with its funeral branches,
and not to know whither we go
or whence we come!...
The princess mourns — Why is the Princess sighing?
Why from her lips are song and laughter dying?
Why does she droop upon her chair of gold?
Hushed is the music of her royal bower;
Beside her in a vase; a single flower
Swoons and forgets its petals to unfold.
The fool in scarlet pirouettes and flatters,
Within the hall the silly dueña chatters;
Without, the peacock's regal plumage gleams.
The Princess heeds them not; her thoughts are veering
Out through the gates of Dawn, past sight and hearing,
Where she pursues the phantoms of her dreams.
Is it a dream of China that allures her,
Or far Galconda's ruler who conjures her
But to unveil the laughter of her eyes?—
He of the island realms of fragrant roses,
Whose treasure flashing diamond hoards discloses,
And pearls of Ormuz, rich beyond surmise?
Alas! The Princess longs to be a swallow,
To be a butterfly, to soar, to follow
The ray of light that climbs into the sun;
To greet the lilies, lost in Springtime wonder,
To ride upon the wind, to hear the thunder
Of ocean waves where monstrous billows run.
Her silver distaff fallen in disfavor,
Her magic globe shorn of its magic savor,
The swans that drift like snow across the lake,
The lotus in the garden pool — are mourning;
The dahlias and the jasmin flowers adorning
The palace gardens, sorrow for her sake.
Poor little captive of the blue-eyed glances!
A hundred negroes with a hundred lances,
A hound, a sleepless dragon, guard her gates.
There in the marble of her palace prison
The little Princess of the roving vision,
Caught in her gold and gauzes, dreams and waits.
"Oh" (sighs the Princess), "Oh, to leave behind me
My marble cage, the golden chains that bind me,
The empty chrysalis the moth forsakes!
To fly to where a fairy Prince is dwelling—
O radiant vision past all mortal telling,
Brighter than April, or the day that breaks!"
"Hush, little Princess", whispers the good fairy,
"With sword and goshawk; on his charger airy,
The Prince draws near — the lover without blame.
Upon his wingéd steed the Prince is fleeting,
The conqueror of Death, to bring you greeting,
And with his kiss to touch your lips to flame!"
There is twilight grey and gloomy
Where the sea its velvet trails;
Out across the heavens roomy
Draw the veils.
Bitter and sonorous rises
The complaint from out the deeps,
And the wave the wind surprises
Weeps.
Viols there amid the gloaming
Hail the sun that dies,
And the white spray in its foaming
"Miserere" sighs.
Harmony the heavens embraces,
And the breeze is lifting free
To the chanting of the races
Of the sea.
Clarions of horizons calling
Strike a symphony most rare,
As if mountain voices calling
Vibrate there.
As though dread, unseen, were waking,
As though awesome echoes bore
On the distant breeze's quaking
The lion's roar.
No.
Wrap your fingers around its curves. Its fruit is soft
and fragile like a heart. It has a spongy pulp and
contains the flavor of the tropics and rain inside.
Enclose it. It has, like an appendage, its seed on the
outside. It has never been a hypocrite.
How different from those fruits that love to deceive!
They appear big and round from the outside. But inside
the seeds are huge like soccer balls.
There are women who cover their faces with congealed
fats. Touching their skin gives us a strange sensation,
as if we were walking at night down a filthy, remote alley.
One of those alleys where the sun never shines as if petrified
with shame.
Do you know any man, woman or child who is like
a cashew?
I am a man, I have been born,
I have skin and hope.
Therefore, I demand,
to be allowed to use them.
I am not a god: I am a man
(it is like to say an algea).
But I demand warmth at my roots,
lunch in my guts.
I do not ask for eternities
full of white starts.
I ask for tenderness, dinner,
silence, bread, home.
I am a man, that is to say,
an animal with words.
And I demand, therefore,
They are impressive, fortunate, made of moon, in
the middle of the night.
They burn like timber. They exude fresh and
delicious water, like the sap of large trees.
They dont seem to come from terrestrial rocks: we
imagine them sprouting from caves more savage and
deep. Or rising perhaps from an oceanic pit
where from sirens they have learned the art of embracing
until arms achieve the transformation into snakes.
If they had names like us, we would not
believe them to be human. We would think of them as inhabitants of
stars unknown, from planets of wheat.
Among shadows they mingle, sometimes, with the
gods. They slip and are frightened like animals, which is
another way of appearing like gods.
They dont dare use the word: they moan and coo. The
shortest words on the earth and more words,
nevertheless.
When I return home I will ask Death not to
come for them. Beautiful it would be for them to be free for
ever and for them to emerge out into the streets joined, like
prophets of a powerful and vegetative ritual.
We would sing them songs of joy and we
would dress them with garlands of fresh leaves. Large garlands
that would comfort them when they find themselves
without pillows in some bitter place upon the
earth.
I do not offer you peace, brother man,
'cause peace is not a medal
peace is an enslaved land
and it is our duty set her free.
I ask from you the love, the tenderness
the muscle, the cries, and the firm grasp,
the swiftness of feet, the song's fire,
the blaze of a glance and of desire.
Equiped with light, with happiness,
with dreams, bodies and souls,
we will go out to take peace by blows
even if we have to tear it appart.
In the October sky the clouds that walk 
with a slow turn simulate frets,
and Phoebe, in the sapphire blue pool,
sees her round freckled face.
Twisted and twisted branches tremble
there in the desolate and barren retreat
and the misty wind sighs
which causes dry leaves to crackle abruptly.
Feigning indifference, fearful
she talked with me,
of our love of one day, of those dreams
of happiness and hope.
In evoking such intimate memories,
let my soul tremble,
and the dead heart, full of life,
I felt it shake.
We talk about love, what about us
far it spread its wings,
and happy and joyful we remember
the past fortune ...
Later ... I told you about my lost illusion,
of my mocked passion,
and I showed you my leprous heart
That scares me myself
You were horrified! ... and bowing tremulously
the face ashamed,
those lips tried for forgiveness
say a word.
But pride triumphed, and you refused
to confess your fault ...
However, from your eyes, trembling,
I saw a tear roll.
Blessed are you who feel and cry
the past fortune!
Woe to him who in his pain does not have
no consolation, no tears!
It is the first hour.
From the orient
comes the sun.
The moon,
despoiled of the gold
of night,
goes down slowly towards the west
that waits for it under the line
of the horizon.
On the basso continuo
of the shore
the waves unravel,
one by one,
the music they bring
from as far
as time,
and its a tune, and another tune
and a thousand more tunes,
rhythmic, repeated,
spilled on the sand.
The seabirds
begin
their flights,
some swiftly, others
unhurriedly
they fall on the water, well-aimed,
they rise up, they fly away
until at last the sun´s glare
stumps them
Little by little you hear
voices, echoes, a song.
The breeze, gardener,
sprinkles orange blossoms
on the bright blue of the sea.
If by some chance we should meet again
on the other side of this or another life,
will we recognize our glances
or will we just be a couple of strangers?
Whatever happens, I will love you as I do always.
Together or separate.
Against the blue of the sky —the sky so clean
that seems to be washed by the hands of God—
How well the tree looks , softly inclined
under the rosy weight of his flowering branches!
I see him leaning his forehead on the white panes
of the window; and he reminds me,
all full of flowers, butterflies and trills,
of a small poem he used to recite...
Who knows of the things the moon tells him
when she comes at night to talk with him!
Many a time Ive seen him ecstatic listening to her
strangely peaceable until dawn comes...
And the breeze no longer runs naked through the fields!
He, every morning, when he sees her walk by,
throws such a pretty satin cape
over her shoulder, in a gentle gesture.
We have been, for some time, the best of friends!
And I, who never tell anybody of my secret love,
have let his soul come near to my lips...
and have given everything to the good, flowering tree!
I never knew its name
It could
have been love, a bit
of happiness, or simp-
ly nothing.
But it lighted up
the day in such a way
that its glow
endures.
It endures.
And it burns.
Death, in Venice,
they take on a trip
like a bride.
Between two blues
the mournful gondola
glides,
covered by slow velvets,
and you hardly perceive
the light thud
of one dip of an oar and then another.
Slowly, follows
like a floating garden,
the one carrying the farewell
made of roses
from friends.
And the mourners close
the cortège,
that is lost in the sea.
Accompanying them,
with its finger on its lips,
silence.
Not far off, the island waits.
Behind the rosy wall
that encloses it
cypresses ascend, tall
and dark.
Some blue and flowered morning
we shall sweetly go, hand in hand
to listen to the stories the brook whispers
before the amazement of the bare stones...
We shall say, love, just one word:
our eyes will speak in their language of magic,
and the curious breeze will arrive quite still
without breaking the spell of the enchanted tour...
Afterwards... like a bunch of beautiful new grapes
—cut from the grapevine by inexpert hands—
I will leave in your mouth with some fear
the ignored flavor of my first kisses...
I want to go back to what once upon
a time we all called our house,
to go up the old staircase,
to open the doors, the windows.
I want to stay there for a while, a while
listening to that same rain —
I never knew for certain
if it was water or music.
I want to go out on the balconies
where a girl leaned out
to see the swallows arrive
that came back in December.
Maybe I can still find it
my eyes fixed on that time,
with a flame of distances
burning on the small forehead.
I want to cross the tepid patio
of sun and roses and grasshoppers,
to touch the whitewashed walls,
the absent echo of the cages.
Perhaps the doves are still
flying around it,
to show me the way
fading in the shadows.
I want to know if what I look for
is in a dream or in my childhood.
For I am lost and I must find myself,
face and soul, in another place.
Let time pass between the two
without letting us change soul and soul.
We have remained fixed, one and the other,
with the impassive solitude of statues,
your face in the background of my still eyes,
my face in your gaze.
In vain are the birds, the clouds,
and the sky always fleeing
toward the sunset.
The sea, the sea of the unfathomable heart with
its spread-out sails and its lighthouses.
The trees that come smiling
through the very first leaves,
the rain that models its fine towers
of glass, the mornings,
summer...
As blind men we are. As blind men
of a luminous wind that lifts us
and takes us avidly,
no one knows where.
And everything surrounds us without touching us
in this fantastic love of love
and of silence.
Theres nothing like this bliss
of feeling so alone
in mid-afternoon
and in the middle of the wheat field;
under the summer sky
and in the arms of the wind
I am one more ear of wheat.
I have nothing in my soul,
not even a small sorrow,
nor an old remembrance
that would make me dream...
I only have this bliss
of being alone in the afternoon,
just with the afternoon!
A very long silence
is falling on the field,
for already the sun is leaving
and already the wind is leaving;
who would give me forever
this inexpressible bliss
of being, alone and serene,
a miracle of peace!
White handkerchiefs
four seagulls say
goodbye to the sky.
To see the dawn
by the scale of the song
the lark ascends.
On the ground
the doves applaud
and fly away.
The swallow
lets fall on the water
its fine shadow.
Keels in the wind,
the pelicans set sail
in the old port.
In its cage,
the airless mockingbird
sings its sorrows.
The humming bird
from one jump to another
makes the whole garden iridiscent.
From snow and mother-of-pearl
through the intact blue
the heron flees.
In the wood
the nightingales
tune their flageolets.
The turtledove
comes to my window
from Umbria.
To soothe my pain because thou canst not love me,
Gazing upon me with an angel's air,
Thou dost immerse thy fingers, cool and pallid,
la the dark mane of my tempestuous hair.
'Tis vain, woman! Thou dost not console me.
We are a world apart, in naught the same.
If thou art snow, then why dost thou not freeze me?
Why do I melt thee not, if I am flame?
Thine hand, so spiritual and transparent,
When it caresses my submissive head,
Is but the snow-cap crowning the volcano,
Whose burning lava-depths beneath it spread!
The evening was mysterious, divine;
Eudora, yet more lovely than before:
and in her eyes there was a spark of fire,
a fierce exultant joy, achieved by wine.
From the high tier, the name she called was mine!
Thanking my stars, I left the place with her,
gentle and bold, as one who leads a star.
Oh, but her voice was tremulous and fine.
And that forbidden fruit unprincipled
wrapped herself in her mantle, and, forgetting
decorum, sought with me the field of honour!
A fine adventure, lovingly recalled.
Rather than dream, I write a sonnet on her,
to catch my sigh, a pearl in a golden setting.
That sun that reverberates hot 
Over the field scorched with its fires,
And the young lily of the toasted orchard
Leave and dry the stream in the meadow;
There, on the cliff of the fierce mountain 
buried under marbled snow,
Turns the tight ice into a stream
that fertilizes sparkling its hillside.
You, sun of love, that in the middle of May
You rise above my funereal horizon
The fire that burns me and illuminates me! ...
May your face not elude me a single ray;
It was my heart snowy mountain:
Make him, burning endlessly green hill.
Amazed at ants that while they come do go
I'm frightened by their self-sufficiency:
for they are what they do no questions asked
and if such bits of life machines are they though small
so perfect that in truth they know
the where and whence that have become their own
and death they would ignore if it were not
at least and last such useful instrument
with which to make new life out of the still.
But though their tiny liveliness increases
the rounded awe in which I look at them
and it does pain me that they'll never know
themselves just as they are in their dark toil
as immemorial now as Earth itself.
my pain as such is more amazing yet
as it does prove that knowing one's own self
is worth all pains though the price becomes as high as
the enormous silence that awaits beyond.
The fragrant now within your eyes no only I love,
I love the hidden child that through them looks upon
the vastness of this world in rounded wonder,
as I do love the gray-haired stranger who remembers me
from her own nook of time that winter shelters.
The multitude of you, your hurrying hours, I love your thousand images
in flight
that are a flock of wild and fleeing birds. Not only do I love your
Sunday of such brief delight
but also a tragic Friday yet, who knows,
a Saturday in triumphs and glories crowned
that I shall never see, and praise no less for that.
A child, a girl, a woman, you are all, against my breast I shelter
them, they fill my heart,
and thus in peace I love you in each and all.
Eternity begins at last one Monday,
the day that follows hardly has a name,
then comes the darkness of the abolished one.
In which familiar murmurings are hushed,
the face we loved begins to fade away,
and hope is useless, no one ever comes.
Eternity ignores our sherished habits,
it does not care for red or tender blue,
but fervors gray, and smoke, and simple ashes.
Name and a date you might engrave on marble,
it brushes them aside in negligence,
no little mound of bitterness remains.
And yet, you see, I closely cling to Monday,
and call the day that follows by your name,
and with my burning cigarette I write
across the growing darkness: here I've lived.
Right in the midst of a whole roaring avalanche of fire stands my father.
The light tears flashes, no, tears leaps of furious snow
out of the flight of steps my father has designed
with humble pride, and all around him fly
in flakes of light the trunks of royal palms.
His clothes in truth do burn as white live coals
that scorch and then transfix and fuse his face
into a joy that goes beyond
the consummation of his project, far beyond
his fierce resplendent stature.
The cat asleep within the kitchen,
the rain runs swiftly outside.
A hundred and a thousand years of gloaming
and afternoon a whiff, outside.
The cat asleep who knows since when
but rain never is the same outside.
At peace the cat, and sleep at peace,
and water fleeing to the sea
outside.
in a dark wood...
A poem is at most
a conversation in the
dusk
besides the ancient oven, when
they have all gone, and out of doors
the deep wood rustles; yes, a poem
is hardly more than a few words
that one has loved, and change
their place with time, so that
they now become a blot, at most
a hope without a name;
a poem is hardly more
than happiness, a
talk
within the dusk, or all
that has forever gone, and is
no more than silence now.
The wondrous band that's on the stand
awakes the twenties' wind,
and blows up high the frosty ribbons
of the slender girl through whom time never passes.
And silent, quiet, lovely, and apart,
she looks with vague and graceful eyes
upon a spring that is no longer here
—so far, so far away the twenties.
Oh, do not gaze into my room, look at the stand,
try not to see this empty page,
but turn around to where the music sounds, the breeze
that blows among the dusty laurel curtains!
For time in you forever stands so still.
A Fina
From time to time the General would say
while spreading wide his thin transparent hands:
and so it was we saw him on that day right
in the midst of the disdainful rain
astride his black, his memorable horse.
The shadow of the roof would come and soften
his shirt that seemed like stark, unblemished snow,
and the harsh curve of his severe profile.
And while inside the patio of finest blue nearby
the sadness was again reborn
that grows at night from the banana trees,
beyond the royal palms, beyond the road, a neat,
clean poverty their uniforms,
we heard our gods in silence riding by.
To Ángel del Río
Upright geyser of shade and slumber,
Who piques the sky with its spear.
A gushing spurt that all but reaches the stars
Unwinding in wild abandon.
Mast of solitude, an island wonder,
An arrow of faith, a dart of hope,
Today I come to you, to the banks of Arlanza,
A chance pilgrim, my rudderless soul.
When I saw your lonely, tender, firm frame,
I felt my anguish dissipate,
And ascend, like you, crystal-sheathed,
Like you, black tower of daunting blades,
A paragon of vertical delirium,
Mute cypress in the fervor of Silos.
Who said that a curve, gold, desire all come to an end
And so does the true sound of moon reflecting off marble
And the perfect pleating of elytra
On movie screen casting its tender protection?
Frisk me
In my pocket youll find feathers a birds virtue
Crumbs in search of bread, moth-eaten gods
Words of love eternal without
A flight plan
And the hidden path of the waves.
summer rain
placing nests in the 
green crowns of trees
dead bird
what a silent agony
of feathers!
Did a tender bush grow
On the banks of a gentle river,
And its dark branches
Very proud he spread;
But in the bitter winter
The river rose like a torrent,
And in its tumid stream
The tender bush led.
Reflecting snow and scarlet,
She was born garrida and pompous
In the desert a rose,
Gala del prado and love;
But he launched with insane fury
His breath inflamed the wind,
And it took away in a moment
Its vain pomp and freshness.
So everything lasts well...
So sweet loves,
Like the lush flowers,
They fade in their dawn;
And in the uncertain sway
From fickle fortune,
Born and dies in an instant
The hope of love.
The girls of the light
who revolve around the sun
sparkle
and laugh
like changeable stones,
they travel on the harmonious cloud.
The girls of the light;
with albino tresses
and flushed faces,
they swim in the sparkling granite.
From a red cloud
their flight secures
a landing
where colorful notes
die in the remote storm-clouds.
and smile.
Dark brown, distant...
the towers battle
presenting
enormous silhouettes.
Golden, distant...
the royal towers
are confused
in their angry flames.
Red, distant...
the towers bristle
purple;
one hears their cries.
Black, distant...
grey hours
are darkened.
Alas!, the dead towers.
The snow-covered dead
under a sad sky
pass along the avenue of pain
that never ends.
They go with the wandering forms
among the silent auras
and from dead they give the cold
to the willows and the irises.
Slowly they shine white
on the desolate road;
and they long for the daytime parties
and the loves of their lives.
When walking, the dead
search for hope;
they look only at the scythe,
their sad shapes absorbed in throught.
In the desolate night of the mists,
and in the prison, in the terror,
the distant walkers pass along
on the unending road.
In the watchtower of fantasy,
in the twinkle of perfume
trembling with harmony:
in the night that flames consume,
when the featherless duck sleeps,
the golden insects annoy,
and fireflies smoulder;
when the striped fairies light up,
when cork butterflies fly
and blonde vampires lisp
or the solid lamp stands out,
in the night of the mothers
with dead eyes and prominent noses;
in the distant watchtower,
by the plains:
the wandering huntsman of faces
watches with diamond eyes
from the sightless heights.
Come let us cat and drink to-day,
And sing, and laugh, and banish sorrow,
For we must part to-morrow.
In Antruejo's honour — fill
The laughing cup with wine and glee,
And feast and dance with eager will,
And crowd the hours with revelry,
For that is wisdom's counsel still—
To day be gay, and banish sorrow,
Honour the saint —the morning ray
Will introduce the monster death;
There 's breathing space for joy to-day,
To-morrow ye shall gasp for breath;
So now be frolicsome and gay,
And tread joy's round and banish sorrow,
For we must part to-morrow.
I reach out with my barbaric hands above the ebony night
in search of God... And at my mast-heads I break out
silence. And I guide wing-borne hurricanes.
And I even bite the fruit of your two nubile breasts
to finds in their swelling nipples, God
marvelously transformed into clear honey.
I would touch him even in the timid caress
of children hanging like lavish apples
upon their mother-trees. And even in the pale
alcohol-flame of your dead gaze. And even in the lamp
that revealed to me your twin naiad thighs
on that Christinas Eve of the first new vines.
And even in the archangelical linen-
dawn of your death I would seek him, and in the tremolo
of an endless evening with transparent rainbows
and paschal lambs of improbable locks
and golden swallows and angelus belltowers.
Even in the soft clouds of a shining autumn
that makes us weep, we do not know why... Lawns
of impalpable beryl have dropped from a poplar.
A thousand crickets are clinking in unison their tiny cymbals,
and a firefiy lights its double candle.
I am at peace. I drift upon moist cotton,
while God swoons sweetly upon my eyelids.
The fog has bandaged my eyes. I am blinded.
The pine grove trembles like a dome
above my rebel head.
Night has an organ sound.
My hands burst into flame.
I have clutched the trunks of the trees.
I strangled the torsos of women
and broke the earth wide, like a belly,
Today! Today!
Thunder, draught of God!
My arms grow huge, like waterspouts at sea.
And I am alone
before my eternity, like the dolmens.
Afterwards, no one will know who puffed up the cyclones,
who opened the abysses like jaws.
No one!
Hurricanes, shout! For I am alone.
The fog has bandaged my eyes. I am blinded!
A thousand, thousand times I seek
My lovely maid;
But I am silent, still, afraid
That if I speak
The maid might frown, and then my heart would break.
I've oft resolved to tell her all,
But dare not--what a woe 'twould be
From doubtful favor's smiles to fall
To the harsh frown of certainty.
Her grace--her music cheers me now;
The dimpled roses on her cheek,
But fear restrains my tongue, for how,
How should I speak
When, if she frowned, my troubled heart would break?
No! rather I'll conceal my story
In my full heart's mostm secret cell;
For though I feel a doubtful glory
I 'scape the certainty of hell.
I lose, 'tis true, the bliss of heaven--
I own my courage is but weak;
That weakness may be well forgiven,
For should she speak
In words ungentle, O my heart would break.
Behold them there: beside the sea so bold—
—the corpses, ah! of men who were the brave
and honored by the free. With death they gave
their souls to heaven, and gave fame untold
to Spain, With love of home and freedom's fold
to swell their fearless breasts' they crossed the wave
and to the southern coasts they came, to save
the land as Glory's sun... sad day of old!
So, Spaniards, weep, but may your tears yet be
the tears of pain and tears of blood that rise
in floods to drown oppressors, and their slaves,
and loathesome tyrants who with shock will see
their foemen menacing before their eyes...
as vengeful specters rising from their graves.
How solitary is the nation now
That peopled countries vast a former day!
That all beneath her sovereignty to bow,
From East to West extended once her sway!
Tears now profuse to shed, unhappy one,
Queen of the world! tis thine; and from thy face,
Enchanting yet in sorrow, there is none
Its overwhelming traces to erase.
How fatally oer thee has death pourd forth
Darkness and mourning, horrible and great!
And the stern despot in his maddend wrath
Exulted wildly oer thy low estate.
Nothing or great or beautiful he spared,
My country! the young warrior by him fell,
The veteran fell, and vile his war-axe glared,
Pleased all its fury oer thee to impel.
Evn the pure maiden fell beneath the rage
Of the unpitying despot, as the rose
Condemnd the summers burning sun to engage
Her bloom and beauty withering soon must close.
Come, O! ye inhabiters of the earth,
And contemplate my misery! can there,
Tell me, be any found of mortal birth
Bearing the sorrows I am doomd to bear?
I wretched, banishd from my native land,
Behold, far from the country I adore,
Her former glories lost and high command,
And only left her sufferings to deplore.
Her children have been fatally betrayd
By treacherous brethren, and a tyrants power;
And these her lovely fertile plains have made
Fields oer which lamentations only lower.
Her arms extended wide unhappy Spain,
Her sons imploring in her deep distress:
Her sons they were, but her command was vain,
Unheard the traitor madness to repress.
Whateer could then avail thee, tower or wall,
My country! still amid thy woes adored?
Where were the heroes that could once appal
The fiercest foe? where thy unconquerd sword?
Alas! now on thy childrens humbled brow
Deeply is shame engraved, and on their eyes,
Cast down and sorrowfully beating now,
The tears alone of grief and mourning rise.
Once was a time for Spain, when she possessd
A hundred heroes in her hour of pride;
And trembling nations saw her manifest
Her power and beauty, dazzling by their side.
As lofty shows itself in Lebanon
The cedar, so her brow she raised on high;
And fell her voice the nations round upon,
As terrifies a girl the thunders nigh.
But as a stone now in the deserts wild
Thou liest abandond, and an unknown way
Through strangers lands, uncertain where, exiled
The patriots doomd unfortunate to stray.
Her ancient pomp and power are coverd oer
With sand and weeds contemptuous; and the foe,
That trembled at her puissance before,
Now mocks exulting and enjoys her woe.
Maidens! your flowing locks dishevelld tear,
To give them to the wandering winds; and bring
Your harps in mournful company to share
With me the sorrowful laments I sing.
Thus banishd from our homes afar away
Still let us weep our miseries. O! Spain,
Who shall have power thy torments to allay?
Who shall have power to dry thy tears again!
Now row, now cast off,
cast off our good boat,
now break through the clouds,
now break through the mists,
the winds and the flames,
the murk and the dark,
the waves of the sea.
Row on, let us cross
the bounds of the world:
Now today the devils, free,
break their sad prison at last,
and with music and with clamor
condemned men celebrate freedom
singing and drinking together
at a dev'lish feast of glee.
I like to watch the heavens
as clouds of black roll by,
and hear the north wind raging:
its terrifying roar.
I like to see the evening
sans moon and sans the stars,
and nothing but scintillas
to lend a little light.
I'm pleased by cemeteries
when packed to overflowing
and dripping blood and gore,
until it takes our breath.
Inside, there stands a digger,
his face all framed with gloom,
as with his ruthless hands
he crushes all the skulls.
I like to see the bombs
fall gently from the sky
and, as it would appear,
lie harmless on the ground ...
and then, in all their fury
to come to life, exploding
and belching lightning bolts,
with corpses everywhere.
May thunder waken me
with hoarse and brutal tread
and make the sleeping world
to shudder and awake.
May countless lightning crash
incessant on the world:
great pleasure's mine to see
the scuttling firmament.
I'd like to light the flame
to burn the city down:
to burn both far and near,
with rubble everywhere.
To see an old man roasting
and burning like a torch;
to hear his plangent pleading:
my pleasure and my joy!
I like the countryside
when blanketed with snow:
the fruit and flower and greens
all being exorcized.
And all the songbirds too,
and not a sign of sunlight,
but only shadow-shows
from all-pervading death.
And in the shady woods
a crumbling mansion stands:
what joy it gives to me
when it reflects the moon
and when the weathervanes
go harshly squealing round
they call to mind the scream
that tells us someone's dead.
I like it when they carry
poor mortals to Avernus
and there they make them suffer
for all the ill they've wrought
by opening their bowels
by tearing out their tendons
by breaking all their hearts
and paying heed to nought.
The unaccustomed freshet
that floods the fertile plain
and reaches mountain-heights
and horrifes us all:
it sweeps away the cattle
and vines without a pause:
such ruin it can cause,
and such delight for me.
The shouting and the laughter,
the gaming and the bottles:
on every side the beauties
that laugh to drink them down
and plant upon the lips
a kiss with every drink:
voluptuous flattery
from every bawdy mouth.
And then to break the glass,
cups, saucers, plates and cards,
and then with razor bared
seek out the nearest heart.
And then to hear the toasting
all mixed up with the moaning
and shrieking of the wounded:
confusion, and the grief.
I'd like to see the man
go dragging his intestine,
while, dying in a corner,
another pleads for wine,
as those already drunk
in unaccustomed phrase
sing out a shameless song
to holy God on high.
All while the mistresses
recline upon their couches
their breasts all bare of ouches
and not a belt in sight:
they show off all their charms,
their hair in disarray,
their lovely thighs exposed ...
What pleasure! What a sight!
Thus is my life,
stone,
like you. Like you,
small stone;
like you,
light stone;
pebble that rolls
over sidewalks
and city paths;
humble pebble of the roads;
that on stormy days
you sink
in the mud of the earth
under the hooves
and under the wheels;
like you, who hasn't served
to be the stone
of a fish market,
nor stone of a hearing,
or stone of a palace,
or stone of a church;
adventurous stone;
maybe you are made
only for a sling,
small stone
and
light...
Christ,
I love you
Not because you fell from a star
But because you discovered for me
That man has blood,
Tears,
Anguish...
Keys,
Tools!
To open light's closed doors.
Yes... you taught us that man is God...
A poor God sacrificed just like You.
And he who stands on your left at Golgotha,
The evil thief...
He too is a God!
Do not take pity on me, Earthshine.
Give me your dark holy bread, your last piece of bread...
A memoryless, one-way dream.
Let me wallow in this cesspit,
Further below the mud and the larva...
Where life is a green phantom
That nobody has even seen.
And this game, Archpriest,
this game with a white ball
and a black ball,
when will it finish?
This game
of noise and silence,
of laughter and crying,
of light and the night
And there is one that asks: what is the night?
And this loose tear, Archpriest,
this loose tear that trickles and slips,
that dances and dithers
in the windmill
where will it stop?
And there is another that asks: but, gentlemen
Why does it play here?
This moral fiction, which the facile Muse,
Thalia kind inspired, and which await
The numerous crowds that throng the Spanish scene,
Therein acquiring voice, and life, and form,
To thee I now present, with feelings pure
Of gratitude and love. By other path
The difficult height of Pindus to ascend,
In vain have I aspired, in vain; and oft
Have wept me baffled, oer the bold attempt.
How often, striking the Aonian chords,
To win her have I sought, so fleeting, coy,
The beauty that in silence I adore!
To imitate the voice and harmony,
Which Echo erst repeated in the woods
Of green Zurgüen: oft as Clio waked
The trumpet that diffuses martial rage,
I wishd, with her sublimest ardour fired,
To celebrate the lofty deeds of Spain:
From her proud neck as beating, broken off,
The barbarous yoke; the conqueror in turn
Conquerd on the burning sands of Libya:
Numantia with the miseries appeased,
Proud Rome was doomd to know, abandond prey
To frightful military outrages:
Cortes, in the valley of Otumba,
Lord of the golden standard, at his feet
The sceptre of the West! but angrily,
Menanders muse offended, soon reproved
My error, and the lyre and pastoral pipe
Snatchd from me, and the clarion of Mars.
Follow, she said to me, the only track
Which my voice indicates, if thou wouldst seek
The honour, that despite of silent death,
May make thy name immortal. I in love
A thousand times upon thy infant lip
Have printed a soft kiss, and bade thee sleep
To the repeated heavenly tones I raised.
Thou my delight wast ever, and my care;
And the propitious gifts, which Nature shed
On thee, it was my joy to cultivate.
Now with loud festive acclamation sounds
Thy countrys scene in thy just praise, on high
Thy glory to affirm. Thou follow on
To sacred Helicon, which Cynthia bathes
With her immortal light, the Muses crown
Of ivy and of laurel there to gain.
Be not offended, Sir, if eer so poor
The tribute that I dedicate; and what
Could worthy be the greatness of thy name?
The gift is humble, the desire is rich;
And not sufficing more my sterile vein,
What I can give I offer. Prostrate thus,
On the rude altars he has raised, is wont
The husbandman to heap the simple fruits
Of his fields gatherd round; and offering them
To the high tutelar deity he adores,
Spreads them forth grateful, incenses and flowers.
Amaz-ed was this Portuguese
In their third year of infancy to see
All children in the French countree
Could speak in French with ease:
The Devils own doing, if you please,
It is, said he, twirling his tash;
To acquire of this vile tongue a dash
A native son in Portugal will
Struggle a lifetime, still speak it ill,
Yet here kids speak it with panache.
When I get back home I dont wash my hands
if I have spent even  an instant with you,
I retain the smell you leave on them
like a vague jewel or an ideal flower.
I smell roses here, and jasmine there,
exhalationss of your clothes, auras of your beauty,
I take a chair and sit at the table
and the bite of bread tastes like wheat and like you.
And everybody wonders why I sniff my hands
or look at them so often with such tenderness,
or I rise them to the moon below the tree groves
as if they were worthy of sinking into your crystal.
And so it goes until midnight when I come back defeated
grazing the walls, and I go to bed,
then I feel jealous of the water that washes them
and which, with your fragrance, sighs and goes away.
Your great grandfather rode through Texas,
Raping copper Mexican girls and stealing horses
Until he settled down with Mary Stonehill and set up house
With oak furniture and God Bless Our Home.
Your grandfather landed in Santiago de Cuba,
Saw the Spaniards defeated, and took home
The waft of rum and a dusky nostalgia of brown girls.
Your father, a peaceful man,
Only paid the wages of twelve youths in Guatemala.
True to your kind,
You took it upon yourself to invade Cuba in autumn, 1962.
Today you fertilise the cotton trees.
Land where the sun forever hides his face
And moon ne'er whitens on thy gloomy brows;
Where Nature, avarous step-dame, scarce allows
A scant provision for the human race;
Oh, what a destiny! were I to trace
(Since I have wandered from my natal boughs)
And end in lone and melancholy drowse
My days of life amid thy snowbound place!
Where never would an amorous shepherd turn
With rose and violet garlands for my tomb
And 'mid his sighs memorial declare:—
Thy hapless ending doth thy Filis learn,
O Tirsis, and two tears she sheds in gloom
More precious than all Niobe's weeping rare.
Put your head out the window
so that my soul doesn't pain,
so that my soul doesn't pain.
Look out as it comes
the fresh light tomorrow,
the fresh light tomorrow.
Appear, and if I look at you,
I'll confess to you my ardent love,
in the rumors of a kiss
and in the swing of a sigh,
and in the swing of a sigh.
You will know that I keep a treasure
for you inside my chest,
get up from your bed
and you will know how much I adore you,
and you will know how much I adore you.
Streets are deserted
clouds wander lost,
and stars are awake
and stars are awake.
Blue... blue... blue was the sky.
You aroused the gentle breeze of summer.
The velvet of the prairie had started
to brown where the river formed a pool.
At a distance, the smoke of a chimney,
like the untouched veil of a bride,
rose until it got lost in the void
in an ondulant and silent flight.
Suddenly you said:  "My love is
pure and gentle, somewhat like that river
that rolls yonder, over that far terrain"
and you looked at me, quiet, serene,
with your soul peeking out of your pupil.
And your soul was as blue as the sky.
Thou heavenly butterfly
Whose great and tenuous wings
Their gold and rose spread high;
Thou that in ample heaven's sight
Over the Andes' mighty summits flings
In bland and radiant flight!—
From what far garden-place,
O Butterfly divine, dost race?—
What heavenly branch or vine
Gives thee sustaining wine?—
Perchance the gardens of the night
Strengthened thy wings of light?—
What gleaming flower shall ease
Thine infinite thirst?
Perchance the golden leas
Where heaven's star-blooms burst?
Perchance the bright horizons filled
With glorious rays,
Where gold dust of thy wings is spilled
O'er seas and mountain ways?—
Come on my breast to lie;
From thy transcendant sphere
Seek out our poor world here,
Ere thee in winging turn
To ashes day shall burn!
If because at your feet I fall
submissive like a servant,
and timidly, almost fearful
I beg a look from your eyes;
if because in your presence
I become ecstatic with emotion,
you believe that my heart
is going to break in my chest
and I will forever be
of my passion a slave;
You are mistaken! You are mistaken,
fresh and fragrant rosebud,
I will break your arrogance
like the miner breaks the rocks.
If to a fight you provoque me,
I'm willing to do battle;
you are foam, I am sea
that trusts in its rages;
you make me cry; but one day
I will also make you cry.
And then, when surrendered
you offer all your life
asking forgiveness at my feet,
because my anger is
infinite in its excesses,
do you know what I'll do
in those moments of indignation?
I will tear out your heart
and smother it with kisses!
Your joy, in flight,
your restlessness, in air;
your life, of sun, of air, of flight.
How small your death
beneath the light of living fire!
How serene the grace of your wings
now held for ever open in this book!
And in you, so soft, in your hushea dying,
in your sleep without dreams,
what magic lost into air,
how much despairing thought!
De un jilguero
A linnet, from a neighboring wood,
His restless wings had spread.
He came ard circled for a time
About any crownless head.
A branch forth from his native wood
Soon in his beak he brought;
And to entwine it round my brow
With wondrous pains he sought.
The efforts of the foolish bird
I saw were quite in vain;
And wearied, from my crownless head
He sought the wood again.
I, knowing his despair, exclaimed
As near me yet he ranged,
If me thou'dst crown, let laurel leaf
For myrtle be exchanged!.
Succulent meatball of gentle tenderness,
pie stuffed with crickets and songs,
a bulky tome of perfumed verses,
chrysalis of silk worms.
Sturdy Skirt or jeans,
Bra made of hands embroidered with fingernails.
Bosom, as the customer chooses
and strong thighs
with gentle scars
on both Skinned knees
Things, our things,
like me to love them:
my table likes me to lean my elbows on it
the chair likes me to sit on its seat,
the door likes me to open and close it,
just as the wine likes me to buy it and drink it,
my pencil falls apart if I grasp it and write,
my wardrobe trembles if I open it and peer inside,
sheets are sheets when I lie on them
and the bed complains when I get up.
What will become of things when man is no more?
Like dogs, they don't exist without a master.
There are days when (Scotch) whiskey
goes to my heart
and makes me glad.
At other times,
it goes to my legs
and makes me old.
And it happens that some of my muscles start to ache
more from what I do
than for what I have.
Between love and friendship
I wobble.
Between all and nothing
between being and becoming
I no longer choose today,
I can't be bothered.
I have the freedom to go out but do not leave,
I have the freedom to do whatever I like
and that's exactly what I do.
[...]
For six weeks I've been looking at the sea
I read, I write something,
peace, silence.
My room on to the sea
seems like a ship.
I go without anyone (at all).
I sail to nothingness.
In this apartment
where I live apart
where I need everything
with out wanting for anything. 
It's not a home,
there's no family,
it's neither a flat nor a house,
it's a square coffin
with a view on to a stable.
It's a (nun's) comfortable cell
with everything
without any thing.
The difference between
a cow and a heifer
is found in the teats,
the cow has them and the heifer does not,
(to compensate,
the heifer has tenderness
while the cow has horns).
The difference between a spinster
and an old maid,
is different:
The spinster is born as such
The old maid is made into such.
The spinster by vocation,
Carries her status perfectly.
The old maid,
spinster by force
with a little bouquet of orange blossoms,
carries her status badly.
Embittered (the poor thing)
A gossiper, etc.,
since she does not live
her life she lives the life of others.
By contrast, compare,
The perfect spinster,
(with apologies to Fray Luis)
is a sweet pear,
a little pear in syrup,
loves without forms and papers
How well does she show off her status!
Where did you get this money and estate?
'Twas by your labor honestly acquired,
Or left you when your relatives expired,
Else it is robber's booty, miser's bait.
That which you give the beggar at your gate
Is noble if your arms to get it tired;
If 'twas a legacy, 'tis nobly squired,
If 'twas a theft—good sir, your pride abate!
I once beheld a wolf that from his feast
Unto a starving cur the bones released
When he himself was gorged and sated through;
So thou, rich glutton, drop the leavings there,
And let the pauper have the mongrel's share,—
Unless the wolf be kinder still than you—?
We are like those who love.
In nude we become two strange monsters
Groping each other tightly,
The scars of unforgiving desire show
That we love tirelessly:
The tedium, the suspicion invincibly ties us
Like two wanting adulterous gods in a web.
Like two lunatics in love,
Two bloodthirsty stars, two dynasties
Hungrily disputing a kingdom,
Wanting to be fair, we stalk savagely,
We trick, we construe vile offences
For which the sky affronts those who love,
Only that a hug sets us a thousand times on fire,
Those who love in this world
Die a thousand times each day.
I look upon my nudity. I contemplate
the appearance of white wounds.
Wrapped in mortal sheets
In feminine waters
I drink sweetness and shade.
You reach the city past countless,
Fire-gobbling tunnels, a frozen storm drain
In moon-drenched fields.
Someone abed in nearby dwellings
Hears the squeaking of valves,
The asphyxiating breathing of iron.
You alight there during another year, another night,
But whither are you wandering, if its already the past?
Scarce is your baggage, some books, letters.
Hands pointing to some pocket track,
The terminal station, the final ticket.
You get to the city hostile and rainy,
The grove smelling of the autumn,
The creaky gates covered in rust,
Gray boardwalk along the river
Of silent funereal motorcades.
I can make out your passing body, 
Through the windshield of oblivion, rotten flowers
Of that which once was, laying siege
To your naked remains, and I behold it all drift apart
With the moist gaze of a dog.
Give me your green hand, seaweed,
Foam's faithful beloved,
For in it I want to read
The sea's good fortune,
That you are in love
None has any doubt:
Neither the beaches, nor the islands,
Nor the eyes of the rain.
Nor the rings, either,
Of wakes surrounding you,
Nor the breeze's does
Racing over the dunes.
Anxieties' blue vein
Beats in your ripe temples.
The salt is always weaving
Orange blossom for your wedding,
The sky, branches of stars,
The moon, ermine furs.
And the fish can no longer
Swim your deep waters
Without feeling they are nightingales
Of the caverns underwater.
And further down, in your
Liquid shadows' depths,
An instinct of corals
Dreams naked throats.
The bords of your domains
Fly you feather beds;
To you forest birds will bring
Epithalamiums of fruits.
(Here the green good fortune
Of seaweed is cut short,
But I can add
Without boasting or bitterness
That if the sea fell in love
More than he had ever done,
It was because my sweet friend
Wet her feet in the foam.)
Other forests came. New ways
Of wilting shadow desposed
Green lattices, the leaves foreboding
Coffered rhythms.
They condemned ears of grain to death.
The washing out of leafage was total
In valleys and mountains and plains.
Everything throbbed
By the kiss of a flower
Collapsed.
And earth filled up with scaffoldings
That were affected neither by springs
Nor senile autumns.
One single season,
In the chaos of spurrings, they imposed
Industrial centers.
Orchestras of emtal symphonied
Coulds of smoke. Diagrams of sabbats
Maddened connecting rods and lightning bolts.
The lights kicked. They plunged us
Into the poverty of a sigh.
After so much crime,
Of murdering valid words
For the sake of plastics,
They found a clover
That had been saved from the fire.
The subjugated machines stopped,
Seeing the freedom of that marvel.
And the asphalt gave birth to green eyes,
Seeing the courage of a leaf.
To the right of the voice of the statue's dream
A river of birds flows by.
The river is a little girl and the bird a key.
And the key a field of wheat
That opens a slow snail of a hundred days.
This means the hills of broken men
Are made of cardboard, wood and green walnuts.
But don't touch that anguish; it's all from the Sunday
When they created the nests in which tomorrow the adultuerous stones will brood.
It's from that fish looking through the sea's eye
At how war is the tenderness guarding the empty beds
And peace that blood with which feet spatter their chains.
Let's go now. Don't pierce the shadow I had four years ago,
For my fingers ache with hunger and my heart with rains.
Better for you to sleep, to go on walking.
I'll wait for you till the tigers, on the lake shore, after the wine harvest,
Lying farmhands to the fields
And shoulders of someone on the deserted promises without water.
To my cousin, Rogelio Trujillo Cabrera, and Isabelita
She starts the day,
Greeting the mosaics one by one,
Stirring them in their calling as mirrors.
What joy to scatter so much night,
To erase so many rings under eyes,
To make the shadows leave in flight!
What a job hers, setting in motion
The linked activity of the things we love,
And they have almost managed to become us,
Lend us features, even a name,
The labored name of our preferences,
Earned with bare hands from years,
Building a face of surprises
With the flow of each instant,
The name we choose through that cosmos
Of Habits and familiar belongings,
More real than the other given us by our parents.
And how a chore so floored
Can produce a dawn so difficult!
She preludes the orchestrated swarm
Of taps, the water's music,
The good days of oiled hinges,
Swaying her amazon breed
In passages, on patios and pavements,
Happy as a harp
Playing in the energy of two arms.
If only her press for purity could clean away
Stabbing ice, grim cries
And clouds of ash.
If she could at least take the dirt from our eyes
So we could see the linked light
Striking the walls outside and our foreheads.
The broom also feels misfortunes,
At times sweeping up tears
And the broken windowpanes of dreams,
And even genuine pieces of herself,
The useless feet of her hope,
Dead now the wish of walking by herself.
But without her Cindrella hustling,
The house could never get up,
Nor welcome friends,
Nor serve as a horse for the little ones.
For there is a great deal of grandmother
In the humanity of a broom.
To Ernesto Castro Fariñas
In this village
The schoolboys draw
Sluggish landscapes of shadow
With greys dying of grief.
The pomp of colors
Here amounts to nothing.
Neither the sunflower of afternoon
In the skies, nor the slope
Of greens uphill,
Nor even the blue lure
Of a rainy foot on the sea
Appear on their palates.
For the man of these fields
Feels his piece of earth
So deep inside himself,
In his closest intimacy,
That when at day's end
He sees his job fulfilled,
The evening grey is already
Ashes of the bonfire
That blazed, while he worked
Without lifting his head.
The sunset's idle show
Neither makes the grass sprout,
Nor satisfies hunger and thirst,
Nor reddems and frees him.
he devotes himself to his hands,
Hands with which he suddenly
Sows, in the same furrow,
His freedom and his censure.
He shares, from the last
Thirsty melancholies,
The equality of seeds
In the bosom of the earth
And that round darkness
Of the womb of harvets
Taking him back to the silence
Of maternal entrails.
Silence of Tacoronte
Hard as stone.
When you move away from
The highway's easy river,
This silence follows you
Like a bulldog
And against him there's no use
Shutting windows and doors.
Wherever you go,
His tongue keeps licking you.
This silence is the must
Fermented by wine-cellars,
The mirror in which rebellions
And sorrows see themselves.
It is the loneliness
Painted by the schoolboys;
It is the heart of man,
His veins pulsing rage;
Alone with ideas inside,
Lonelier, ideas outside.
Silence that never doubts
Treads firmly and tests
What still remains in us
Of island and volcano.
And amidst this silence
That yields to no one,
The night of Tacorante,
Vintageress of stars,
Into the comfort of her
Dark tresses, lets sink
The hands of him who works
And the brow of one who dreams.
To Justo Jorge Padrón
A bud from the sea has reached my feet.
Unexpectedly
It sprouted from the womb of a wave
With its body of sobings and murmurs
As if it were truly a life.
Such pure vapor,
Such seething milk,
Crowned its hurried existence
So its spark of water left an opening
Not even to memory.
I have hardly been able to keep an instant
Its time of dying,
Its swift birth to death.
And maybe the whole soul of an island,
More than an obsession of rocks standing fast,
Is a bud of binding sea.
Para ir al infierno no hace falta cambiar de sitio ni posturaRafael Alberti
Who knows the winds, who distantly
creates a voice in which to guard memory,
who knows his naked skin
like he knows the trace of his name,
and does not fear it, and accompanies it
beyond the winter pent up in his syllables,
who decides everything in a night,
suddenly, like a kiss,
who appears out of the fog on a bridge,
who rubs his fingers over his own emptiness,
who leaves the sea, who loses
the fear of becoming distant.
In the weakened
purple shadow of the waves,
where go sinking with the port
the ancient signposts and lights,
there will float waiting
new conversations in the water.
They will be the forced disillusion
that falls from the rigging with the breeze,
returning to memory
the tempest of speech
or words split like masts.
Because dreams leave
debris like shipwrecks,
with wood and bodies sunken in the sheets,
full of dominated freedom.
It is not the unclean city
that pushes the candles. Neither does the heart,
primitive cabin of desire,
adventure in ignited islands
where the sea hides its ruins,
seaweed of Baudelaire, foam and silences.
It is necessity, the solitary
necessity of man,
that brings us to shelter,
that makes us tremble, live in bodies
that resist the voice of sirens
tethered to the bow,
with the wheel turning between their hands.
Move away from there, let us go far,
without the illusion that calls desperately,
without the pain that takes on decency.
Skin, my skin, the winds
have asked so much on the shores,
so much have they crashed like stars over cities and chests,
that they do not know motherlands nor do they sing of them,
they do not remember nations,
only dreams.
I know their return
is ours without a doubt. Because with a human voice,
like old sailors,
over the blurred pain of their backs,
they will return to tell us:
it is time,
let us return with the tide.
The courage and force of twilight
will carry you to the bottom of what is already known,
and we will see warships over the black puddles,
but the cleaved silhouette of a child
will be neither fragile nor weary.
In this way, after the journey,
surprised and mute before the ghost,
while rise slowly with the port
we will hear the song of those who arrive,
of those who step ashore when they have been
expected for many days.
And the sea, the sea sweet and so tragic,
subjected to its own distance,
will know how to leave written
that the journey was never our treasure,
nor was it the famous pain of poems,
but the dreams placed in the street,
the beds and the sea's mist,
the awakening from so many long nights
where we could only presage,
speak of desire in the shadows.
Beside your hair, capital of the winds,
history in two, the noise of tears,
they must be the necessary past,
remote mystery,
things to tell after some years,
if someone asks about us.
And yet, and necessarily,
between the low night and this house
where I am wont to write,
I will await the lips
that with a strange call ask me again:
Prison of love, for whom do you carry
one man of glass and the other of oblivion?
The skies grow used to surrendering
lifelessly to the asphalt.
The light moves in search of bodies.
Its mechanism is sweet and it repeats,
like your heart
when it preferred me.
An ownerless shadow,
something that is not night
but that walks out of night's womb,
upon returning it draws near, it becomes confused,
it passes slowly until it is lost.
I watch my loneliness
return without me, naked,
from where I carry it,
in the umbra defeat of its steps,
from doorway to doorway, murmur of no one.
There,
distant and green at times,
with promises of clumsy seduction,
the city awaits me, its lonely
meekness of an aged lover.
Nervous in haste,
like lives or candles without destiny,
the windows of the car quicken their journey
in the last fields.
The wind pushes now strange enrollments,
as it must push indifferently
yellow gulls into the trees
when autumn arrives.
the green call of cypress
resembles a sad mast
because it gives
the smell of an old port,
drunk sailors in the shadows.
That tremble of thigh
and little lace
brushed by fingertips
are the best memory of a few days
known without hurry, without documentation,
like timid friends.
It was the afternoon before the storm,
thunder in the sky.
You appeared in the garden, secret,
dressed in clothes of a different time,
with an extravagant manner of wanting me,
pretending to be the wind in a wardrobe,
the light in black silk
and glass stockings
so pressed
to your thighs, forcefully,
with that dark force
of their masters in life.
Under the confused color of the wild flowers,
unexpectedly you offered me
the memory of your open lips,
some difficult clothing, and the beam of light
barely glimpsed on your flesh,
like lunatic fire,
like the flame of an almond tree where I placed
my hand without doubt.
In the garden, the noise of the last birds,
of the first raindrops in the trees.
and little lace, of trespassed body hair,
its elastic resistance
defeated by the pass of the years,
become real again, swell of waves to the touch,
damp sand between the hands,
when again, here, in my thoughts
I give myself up to the difficult solution of your groin
and I stop writing
in order to call you.
Under the burnt light
your eyes are cold seeking
these October hours
and their garden stained in gin,
dry leaves, silences
that speak of us as they fall.
Because if it no longer exists,
although no one worries about his solemnities,
there are nights in which the truth,
that uncomfortable guest,
arrives and leaves us dirty, empty, without tobacco,
like in a restaurant of chairs mouth-up
and about to close.
They are waiting for us.
I know not how to answer you,
only that I am conscious of my own irony,
because man is also a wolf with his own self.
Black and tall, silent vultures,
they wait for us, those clouds in the street.
Under a cold polygon rain,
with a storm-drugged sky
and suburban clouds.
Because this love of borrowed keys wraps us
in a provisional intimacy,
walls that provide no company
and objects like owls in shadow.
They are
the saddest sheets of the earth.
Look
how the people live.
To grab someone at the waist,
rest in the borders,
imitate a much less social desire—
life tends to be like this dance,
like el último tango of the night.
Next to the humid orchestra
that plays by memory
and out of happiness,
partners pair up and mirrors watch.
Paris on the screen,
an empty house,
two bodies empty and touching.
The cold of the street. The slowness of the world
and a cigarette for the road.
Like he who has left the battle,
like he who runs to arrive on time
through enemy camps,
chosen among nobles for his history
to save the last words,
like an unhappy messenger, the day comes to us
and his horse is a cry of alarm.
May he take possession of our dream.
He will not find monarchs in the throne,
nor swords that invite him to bow,
nor old sentries at the door.
He will discover again the battle
from which he could never separate himself,
and two bodies who know his news
will await him in the castle.
What will they be like, the lights of which you speak?
Do not ask about me.
Write about names of cities,
announce your clumsiness so as to die in them,
so as to hide me inside their birds' wings.
In your language you tell me
the weary presence of a strange
occurence of strange trees,
of weird buildings, old theaters without an appointment,
where the only familiar spectacle
is the stolen,
greedy illusion that calls you
as you cross the street.
You tell me I walk like the crowds
and the voice freezes us quicker than water,
and over the ice dream words
loaded with cities,
because they know we are weak,
capable of living a lie
that hides too much loneliness.
Here, I too hope they will embrace me,
that once I will be embraced
by some spirit.
Like a strident rooster
the telephone wakes me.
Two in the morning. There is news of you.
Like a stretched-out cat,
your clothes watch us
from the foot of your bed.
And your body recently
could have been in them
still,
planning their leap,
waiting to crash
wildly against my body,
which also pursues us,
at the edge of the chair,
embracing its own
long darkness.
Eyes that were made
to see
an accepted danger,
under the light of the moon.
When I bring my ear to your neck
—as one listens to the sea—
one hears love. I do not know if the wind,
that animal that whistles in your veins,
knows the terrible region where it calls,
the old cliff that exists behind its voices.
But the aquatic light comes to us
more somber each time,
full of guarded loneliness,
with the smell of grass that marks all drowned people.
When your heart is a timekeeper
entangled in mine
and rhythmically
we are naked ships that sink,
when the surface
lasts for only a second,
mermaids tell us we have disappeared.
The metro too whistles below the sea.
One hears love at your neck.
The sunken city awaits us.
The sea
that closes and opens
like a book with pages of foam,
surprises us in your mouth,
under your hair scattered between my thighs.
I praise your scandals
and the sulfuric rain you summon
or the sweet politics of your illusions,
visible like lips in the dune
laid against other lips.
Because the body knows a memory
that is neither reality nor dream.
Remember:
behind every gesture we guard a name.
In more than thirteen nights
I have spent thirteen dreams with you.
I would know how to tell you...
In your marijuana-colored eyes,
you guard a slow proposition of bliss,
a boat that recedes without showing us its back.
You undress daily
in a way that will never become one of my poems,
your syllables become enemies of time,
with unfolded gestures you unfold our clothes
and a strange arrogance takes over me,
suddenly becoming its custom.
And I, who do not confess to owing you all I have
because one inherits verse like nostalgia,
I do not dare to tell you
the sensation of hearing your closeness,
the surrender you give me with the heat of your skin,
my indispensable feelings.
This moon the color of an old saxophone
will keep me in Paris.
This moon the color of an old butterfly,
of an old soul seeking in the wind
eyes to watch the end of the century,
cats who are the doubts of the night.
Lie down with me. Wake in your memory
that restlessness that guards those that finished loving,
the imperceptible hurry of lips
that seek a neck on which to rest their breath.
And let me look at you, face to face,
with these same oriental eyes
that love uses to watch us.
This lost kingdom
where each politics takes the form of a kiss,
of a private scar
behind our embraces,
it is dominating us with its dreams,
from distance to distance.
I want you to rise
with the impatience of the trees,
growing until the exact moment
to rub my lips, to seek in them
wetness without rain.
I know we will discover
naked silhouettes in the house,
visiting memories,
ghosts of a night without summer,
that will wander in us and will ask for the bill,
because darkness, like a mirror,
returns to us the image it gives.
But I know all the questions
that I cannot answer,
the body where live the interrogations,
your dream caught in the handkerchief, as if you had cried it out.
This city invites me to want you.
I see its houses red in the dawn,
and they look like organized bottles
on the counter of a bar,
jungles in which to live
from cup to cup.
Last generations
of difficult girls,
of boys bound to pride
and old turntables, they remind me
that on some terrace by the sea,
under the heat of a world,
I too stood
with that same lack of existence.
(Sand in bra and jeans,
thigh buried, body hair one with the moon,
hands bestowed
to separate shadow from profile,
they came to tell me
that I should cede not a palm's width of terrain
in my invasion of the body that simultaneously invades us).
Tasting of ice,
on ships that seemed not to move,
undefined and distant
they continue dancing there, seated in my eyes.
Each time more distantly
this music reminds me
that we do not all go down to the sea
on a possible night
of ignited wetness in summer.
I inherited almost nothing,
only temptation and her smile
and those elevators
smaller than a kiss.
Granada looks in the mirror of metaphor. Overhead, anchored in a forest like a ship in the greenish water of its port, La Alhambra guards its
silence against the city and allows itself to stare, responding just as a metaphor would to the restless eyes of those who must seek it.
It appears around a corner, between two buildings, above a plaza, on the windshield of a car waiting at a stoplight. It appears suddenly,
straight and noble, surrounded by itself, able to suggest free water and rest to all hearts pierced by a hook of smoke.
In the windowpanes, in the storefronts, in the mirrors of the nocturnal bars are reflected the faces of those who need oxygen, the silver fish
that bends and dies in the hard, dry cobblestones. Whoever looks it in the eye can find La Alhambra.
Everything conquered is lost. Fountains and myrtles that murmur of beauty and murmur of death.
...en un rincón del año...V. Huidobro
To imagine the possible places you are,
to see you arrive nightless to La Tertulia,
to recognize your hurried voice
upon telling an anecdote
or asking about me,
to know that we saw each other before knowing each other,
these are long chapters of my life.
I suppose they will leave to you as well
this same emptiness,
this impatience to be alone
while we forget
all heat that aches of being forgotten.
The shipwreck is a kindred gift to man.
After it happens
footprints tend to have
that discomfort of lies,
memory is dogma,
loneliness my chest that you caressed.
But to change the subject,
time —a good friend
who deforms the past like love deforms a body—
will ensure that each day looks not like a gunshot,
that we will see each other again on some afternoon,
in the corner of a year and without feeling
too much impotence.
It will surely be
like becoming again,
like living again in a difficult era
or getting drunk together
to experience our hangovers separately.
Like burns under our fingers,
on a second floor
we will continue to be present and waiting
for that exact moment of shipwreck on the shore,
when upon leaving the sea
you write me in the sand:
I know love exists,
but I don't know where I learned that.
Truth occurs as infrequently
as lie. To return
is a seizure of power over the body,
armed with neither falsehoods nor nudity.
Here again, the traveler embraced,
ill-timed figure of some dawn,
with the humidity of June
under betrayed clothing,
afraid to pause or to decide.
Here again, with me and your eyes,
because the sun rises behind our back
and the old doorways are a refuge
where darkness has the skin of a throat,
imaginable only next to my lips,
under your hair,
compañero in the night still open,
to halfway tremble, tolerate breath,
redirect words in silence.
Here again. Again
without excuses, without order, with the nostalgic pain
brought on by defeat,
because life is beautiful in the embrace,
your body the reason
and I the desire.
You owe the south a letter, like history.
I wonder about you, about what now,
leaning on my shoulder, you would say to me
upon contemplating the careless passing
of people in the park, their outline
against the first light of winter,
when the cold slides along
the sick trunks of the trees.
I am lacking your opinions at my side,
while children yell and put on jackets,
walking like schoolchildren, and workers
speed up the necessary march
before maids, soldiers
that confuse their clothing
with the sick tones of winter.
I no longer know if you remember the hustle
of the distant stores, the women
bent over and clean with their baskets,
or the drink sellers,
the poor street market stalls
that sell lies
with the sick haste of habit.
And yet it exists, you tell me,
the south exists too in this park
taken by the cold, while pass
—like the collars of teenagers who wait—
raised questions,
stubborn hopes,
the sick secrets of the future.
The pines have reached their pensiveness.
Your loneliness, so poorly documented,
ignores that people roam the street
a little more naked
and that skin opens to a sky
of tumultuous blue,
half song, half false coin.
And over the fields,
spring returned
under the transparency of a dress
or in the ambiguous garden
that rests
—startled by blackbirds and swifts—
with life against the wall of the house.
Only in you, like shadows,
do the intuitive bodies rise,
the halfway footprints of the birds,
that foreignness
of their games in the navigable air.
And you watch them rise,
maybe disappeared,
scheming in the branches where love schemes
to write the verses
born of us
as a shipwreck is born of the sea.
You represent two things:
sadness and beauty,
limitation
and the wings of a dream.
Maybe I awaken
and someone
naked like I am
is at my side,
with an unexpected loneliness
and eyes in debt to the night,
talking to me about you,
asking for the story of your absence.
They follow me,
the broken telephones of Granada,
when I go to find you
and whole streets are communicating.
Submerged in your conch-shell voice,
I would love the sea, out of a mouth
pressed against mine,
knowing that it is calm at a distance,
while gardens
pass, breathe,
retract
on their instinct of absence.
In them nothing exists
ever since those summers began to kidnap you.
Only I inhabit them
to discover the face
of lovers who kiss,
with my eyes out of work,
my heart without traffic,
the insomnia that guards the August cities,
and ambulances secret like birds.
Nothing lonelier than pain,
because it excludes too he who feels it,
whether his pain is a betrayal or a companion.
From my own emptiness
forever I the excluded.
You,
so disappeared,
swallowed by the earth like passing rains,
you can be beneath the shadows
that share night with my shadow,
in bars open like wounds,
burger joints
that the city inhabits and decorates
with the immobile sadness for sale in a cabaret,
where people shed
the modesty of knowing themselves to be tormented.
Next to the dead cars at the edge of the street,
there is an empty place that becomes a teardrop.
And I,
desperately I wander it,
because my eyes too
roam the city seeking a parking space
in the final hours of this endless Monday,
remote and alone.
I need silence as much as secrets.
Sometimes, like them, I need light,
while all streets
decide to anchor themselves in pools
and the sky
of the lonely supermarkets
looks too much like your eyes.
But night goes down
to sit in the plazas at night.
the sought-after seats of twilight,
so said someone who tried
to start a conversation with me.
And I spoke of you, I spoke of the weeks,
of the interest the days show in not passing.
These are not blue days,
but the sea attacks us on the highway,
drawing near its waves
—martial and ebbed—
like old soldiers to the shore.
Also like an orgasm.
Reflected on the windshield
are ferries with women's names,
making love in the bay
making do with the sea.
This is not the 18th day.
We tear it finally from the calendar,
and this rain, peaceful in summer,
fills us with a smoke like that of
the cigar you sometimes enjoyed sharing,
so as to love me slowly,
to continue caressing me.
A teenager with a dragon's stare
brings our suitcases to the tenth floor,
leaving us next to this dubious sky
whose body is sore
from so many gray clouds and storms
that moan like you when I kiss you.
Tomorrow, when we wake, the sea will be
a cold sheet, fallen to the floor.
...madrigal...
Eyes of mine, laden,
you watch me with anger
as the party ends.
Arrested,
with the impatience with which a soul takes note,
you notice me at the instant
of some decision,
at the strange presence, emaciated,
of another necessity
and of another body,
while you pass whistling over my temples.
You have loved much, I know,
but you love like he who leaves one hundred witnesses,
one hundred dreams in a single night, one hundred different traces
of the same passion, gentler over time,
legendary.
Nights of rock, leisurely, on the outskirts,
and a dark patio where desires mature,
where leather jackets confuse
with the smell of life.
Memories turned into Holy Days.
A history lacking credit with today,
and above all a world much less
marginal than its verses,
you summon me here.
This world you place in the mirror,
eyes of mine, laden.
A Francisco Brines
It seems that it is I to whom it draws near,
who walks tall around my legs,
resting its skin against my chest,
when they draw near, the memories,
those somnambulist cats of time
who keep watch together
like spoken words
fallen on the white
tablecloth of those parties.
Where is memory,
behind what heartbeat does it rise
to show its face,
the treasure it carries in its undereye circles
of lost songs, of promises
that launch us suddenly somewhere else?
My history is not a book, like you say,
it is the rounded corner of a page,
because to think also of what I have not been
defines me more exactly
by choices
or presentiments,
because there are verses that never get written
and the loyalty I have to poetry:
it is too weak,
it respects not even nostalgia.
Forgive me. Do you remember
the game of growing up alone,
of a voice that calls you by your name?
Life does not betray, it only exists
in a different way than what was expected
and it is fair that it takes care of itself. I summon it
when I feel like wasting it.
You pass like a scandal through the streets.
Among the green old men of the trees
light imagines you,
as it places its spider on your shirt
with a merciless invitation
to bear the dark, fugitive
will of bliss.
You pass like skin under a hand,
train smoke, that broken silence.
And I am the city as I look at you,
that heat of plastics and bodies
that would like to suddenly possess you
with its stained arm.
But only the afternoon
may welcome the lost footsteps,
the worn blue of your jeans,
the path of your eyes and the ships
when you round the corner.
For her,
queen of the bars,
queen of the seas of gin,
full of tempests.
To collect your footprints,
snow has fallen
over the sidewalk.
The snow of December,
that asks you to return
as it lies down.
Since sunrise,
without becoming at all humble
under your feet.
How solitary I live
in this
cold heart.
Where snow waits,
preparing its return
for your footprints.
In September
your lips fill with cellars
and the sky is prejudiced
having seen you ask life questions.
Yet also the sky,
wrinkled and precise
like your teenage windbreaker,
wants to be halfway open,
shine, having been recently loved,
resting in the grass
the weight of its long mane of cloud.
yeses fill your mouth with smoke.
Because tobacco writes loneliness,
verses of opaque love, while it delays
that exact moment of sitting down,
of seeing the glasses dead on the table,
the room in a dream,
and the injured restlessness
of the door closing
for the last time, on this night.
Through words those that grow distant take leave.
I loved loneliness, but it is a lie
that I grew with her. I do not remember
the broken wire fences of the moon
if it is not through other eyes, nor do I know
a greater illusion than the sea caught in other hands.
But here too, here confusedly,
watched by books with insomnia, by records
not entirely chosen,
you were wont to hide in the gloom,
inhabit the bodegas of silence,
seeking a reason to rise later
under cover, with the moon.
And so one is grateful for the city,
to have her here, sleeping,
wrapped in her sheets of light,
fearsome and ruthless like a pirate ship
in which one cannot trust
but that always, always harbors us.
Because of those nights, that day
we both knew something,
beyond memories or pleasures.
And not love, not its wordiness,
not will,
that moral that stuns as we love.
Someone I barely know,
tired of waiting, surely
asleep with impatience,
when he breathes he lashes me, from another room
over my bed.
Someone who waits still
to hold himself down for an instant, to caress a body
without questions.
The sun is weak, the reason does not matter
and I will draw near to the sheets slowly.
Avoiding the I love you,
in the confusing lucidity of the dawn
we will leave the night behind,
just as a ship leaves at its back,
like an immense footprint, the sea entire.
And as we kiss,
I will remember without a doubt
other sunrises in the water,
looking at my reflection face-to-face,
with the same fear of going under.
Rarely do two joined solitudes
resist words.
Who goes there,
unending verse among my verses,
neglected dream,
silence of lights and doors?
after having left, persisting
with eyes of battle,
under the dead shadow of keys?
coming without arriving, vacating
the tone of his voice,
the unending count of his steps?
In those same lips that have packed your bags
I sought the heroes of destiny.
They came one day to bring you with them,
and I understood that no one understands anything.
Remember that you exist only in this book,
that you are alive thanks to my ghosts,
to the passion I inject in every verse
in order to remember the air you breathe,
the clothes you put on and I take off,
the taxis in which you travel every night
(siren and heart of the cab drivers),
the drinks you share in bars
with people who live on those counters.
Remember that I wait for you on the other side
of the train tracks when you arrive late,
that the telephone, uncomfortable sentry,
becomes a guest without news,
that there is an empty rumble of elevators
complaining alone, convening
as they lift or lower your nostalgia.
Remember that my kingdom is the doubts
of this city that has nothing but haste,
and that freedom, terrible swan,
is not the nocturnal bird of dreams,
it is complicity, toughness
wounded by the sword that forces us
to know we are literary characters,
true lies, false truths.
Remember that I exist only because this book exists,
that I can kill us both by ripping a page.
Red tremble of brakes at night:
so I dream of love, so I remember.
Between the forgetful dawn,
sensations of murky intimacy,
when to have a familiar partner
is a relief for the alien.
Blurred gravity of windshields
in carefree seduction.
Because cars know their path
and they move like instinctive animals
toward home, surely, between our kisses
that last the length of a stoplight
and a little more; because to say tomorrow
is almost to discuss the beyond,
and we speak of the pain of schedules,
remote, succumbing to imprudence,
like the living speak of death.
The days take off their shoes
to pass by without us realizing.
They are almost dismissed, almost encounters
—happy but uncomfortable—
of bodies that watch each other
and postpone their appointment.
Although in the background,
we are left with footprints that are not memories.
In that uncultivated garden I keep
the man who came to desire you,
to walk without you,
wild and alone.
Because of you spoke the oleanders,
with their difficult branches like teenage girls,
and the palms tall like your nakedness,
and that confused sky
that sought
the light by which love distinguishes your eyes.
We age not at all. Maybe we never age.
And now I can tell you,
when you remind me of oleanders,
and your arcuate nakedness sketches a palm,
and your eyes mist
over the wild garden of lovers.
Maybe we never age. Or perhaps it is that time
took off its heels so as not to bother us.
Or perhaps desire
walks our lips barefoot still.
If I ever tell you life is a lie,
talk to me about love or about your body,
of night with you.
And remind me later
of the days that are days because someone loves me
or perhaps
because you prefer me.
They are suspicious of us. The first bus
has passed, and it surprises us
at the scene of the crime,
necks and hands untied,
at the point of death, giving in.
The light calls us to a halt,
we feel its revolver at our backs,
too indecisive,
its tremble in us, covert
under the small forest of the sheets.
Run!
Grab your love and run inside your body!
There is a lawless canyon in our lips,
a labyrinth whose exits are burning.
Look at your heart or your waist,
that castle overhead
that my thighs crown like a lake of fog.
It heeds only the wind of our skin,
passing and returning.
And may the blasts sound,
may the gunshots sound,
may the sirens sound at your back.
Sé más feliz que yo.JUAN AROLAS
I am happier than I, it is not my habit.
I was afraid to know it.
Your heart, closed for renovations,
goes wandering in music,
not wanting to answer me.
Always the outlaw, it does not resist
coexisting under this metal
kingdom of words.
The gaze it carries knows
that errant pain
of nocturnal ships.
It became a witness to tell me
of the doubt in my eyes
and the song they hide.
It is silence, silence nonetheless,
emptiness fettered
to moonbeams.
What road without crosses, without kilometers,
knows how to lead me to it?
Where can I find it?
Love, you call me, I catch a taxi,
cross the excessive reality
of February to see you,
the transitory world that offers me
a seat in the back,
its refugee vault of dreams,
intermittent lights like conversations,
signs ablaze in the breeze,
which are not destiny
but are written on top of us.
I know your words will lack
that lavish tone, that the unquiet
airs of your hair
will keep the artificial nostalgia
of the lightless cellar where you wait for me,
and that, finally, tomorrow
upon waking,
between things halfway forgotten and details
taken out of context,
you will have pity and fear for your self,
shame or dignity, uncertainness
and perhaps lustful unrest,
the blow given to us
by stories told in a night of insomnia.
Yet we also know that it would be
worse and more expensive
to bring them home, to not hide the body
in the smoke of a bar.
I come without languages out of my loneliness,
and without languages I go towards yours.
There is nothing to say,
but I suppose
we will speak of this while naked
sometime, lessening its importance,
reviving the rhythms of the past,
things far away
that no longer hurt us.
You who are not the sea,
who trembles like a bird when wind looks at you,
who wanders the rocks, the sun of the shore,
the reason of the ocean.
You —this awakening without a compass—
who navigates the wisest calm and the storm,
unpredictable weather, tempestuous skin
at the light of the sheets.
who will not always return,
who fills with written bottles and hangovers
the lips of the earth, the cloudy waist
of the last moons.
You who gives order to salt,
you will have a long dream,
they will tell you the story of a shipwreck.
You had a heart, once. Only distance
remains under your chest, only
the exercise of living, the haste
of loving loneliness like a ghost
reduced to instinct, and necessarily.
And necessarily you have understood
that the last kisses were panic,
not even doubt, the astounding
desire to live with one's questions.
And to celebrate
that fog too pertains to us,
we stir up memories, we scatter books
distantly and newspapers,
we pursue a world of impermeable journeys.
November is a sentimental
disorder", you tell me.
So we kiss
and your eyes, mine,
begin to fume,
to colonize the doubts of our rooms,
escape from the windows of our house,
entangle themselves in the streets and cut through neighborhoods,
making the city flood
while, love, you tell me weakly
that you will not return with me,
not now.
I know
that tender love chooses its cities
and each passion takes a home,
a different way to wander the hallways,
to turn off the lights.
And I know
that there is a sleeping doorway in every lip,
a numberless elevator,
a stairway full of little parentheses.
I know that every illusion
has a different way
of inventing hearts or pronouncing names
upon answering the telephone.
I know that every hope
seeks always a road
to cover its naked shadow with sheets
when it wakes.
that there is a date, a day, behind every street,
a desirable rancor,
a halfway repentance of the body.
that love has different letters
with which to write: I'm leaving, with which to say:
I decided to return. Every time of doubts
needs its scenery.
Oh, my friends, when I die, plant a willow on my grave!A. de Musset
When in the glass of my brief day
The sand runs out, and to my rest,
Where sleep the dead, I'm borne away,
Remember this my last behest.
Thrust my remains in none of those
Grim vaults that line the sullen walls,
In whose dread chambers, dark and close,
Our glorious sunlight never falls.
Seek me an open space below:
There, neath the sward make ye my bed,
Where sunbeams play, and breezes blow;
And flowers and shrubs there fragrance spread.
That I may feel —while time rolls on—
Around, above me, ever near,
The warm rays of my country's sun,
The sod of my Borinquen dear!
The rain on the sea.
In the open window
contemplating it, you rest
your brow on the glass.
An image of some seconds,
quiet against the light
your body changed
still naked from the night
And you turn to me
smiling. I think
about how time has passed
and I remember you.
I fall in such a state, once I've seen
the cruelty of my shepherdess,
that I don't even know who I am now,
nor what will become of me.
I know very well, that if a man were,
the pain would have me dead,
and If a stone were, it is very true
that crying would undo me,
Call me Marcelio,
but I belong to a shepherdess,
Have an end my sad life,
because as much as I cried,
it is not my grateful grief,
nor do they believe my faith.
I'm in such a sad state
that I will take side
of being badly awarded
just that it was believed.
Even though my life saddens,
and in my constant evil I'll be,
Sweet Mother and Lady,
Come back to the peace of your tranquil lares,
Like the white aurora
That sweetens sorrows
and sheds light and hope to seas.
Come, that the wounded soul,
your friend-voice missed a lot:
Let's the palm sprout again
That in more serene days
She saw us at her shadow free of spite.
Oh, how much my surrendered heart,
that loved you, wanted
To see such a joyous day;
Oh, how much my slave soul sighed
For her sweet chains!
At the murmur of the river,
At the sound of the wind among the trees, 
In tender delirium
We asked for your accent
And the sad thought flew to you.
The star of hope,
White lantern of our dark sky,
Rest and well-being
And joy and consolation
Perhaps he promised so much longing.
Blessed is his holy dawn
What beautiful hours it gave us,
That in a flattering song
The tears exchanged
And he guided you to the love of your children!
Blessed, yes, a thousand times
And always our eyes illuminate
And hear our prayers
Without its light declining,
Nor from sunset to term lean!
And enjoy yourself in good time
The caresses of your sweet loved ones:
Your benefactor star
Ask the soul for joy
From a century of happiness and delights.
What if it is to love life,
If happiness is encrypted in loving,
Who as you, dear?
Who as you, the expected one?
Who like you, whom everybody wishes?
With the antipodal lights of the air,
The batting of darkness's eyes;
The sun resides amidst culverts:
The sun, of grimacing laughter,
The sun, of sulphurous sheets,
The bazaar of the redheaded clouds
By winter's wicker hands sown.
The sky, in decapitated light,
Ignites, proclaiming red syllables;
Life is not a poem about landscapes,
It is the cobra of fire of death,
The darkness's certified post.
But we live bereft of the scalpel
That lances the schwingmoor: imago mundi
In the instant, not its succession,
But hanged from the ignited flint,
On the concave cuirass of air.
Che morte tanta n'avesse disfatta
We never believe it: the villa
With the phosphorescent loggia
Is only a glimmer in our eyes,
Like the light of the wind in Compostela,
Like the garden of gargoyles and spirits,
Like the white-horned sky's disarray
In the night of ferruginous lime;
Let us pass through the burnt air to heaven,
Let us pass through yesterday's mist;
The day has reaped its tarantulas
Engulfed by the light's condescension:
Drawn up in themselves, the storm clouds
Prolong not, but gather the air,
Like life in a coffer of snowflakes,
As in the inertness of years;
We feel the wind in our groin,
A friend's voice echoed back in carved stone,
The blind cavalcade of Tiresias.
Unreal City, but city of escutcheons:
Escutcheons of pomp borne aloft,
Hothouse in eyeless combustion.
Thus the ice foresaw the bonfire, wavering:
Thus death stalked the springtime of life.
Every poem has a single theme:
How the word says something else.
The sparrow hawk lives blind and serene
In the murk of the final words.
I walked on these streets in the years
When my youth was a dead she-wolf,
But they were unreal, not drawn out
Yet, or drawn out and entombed.
They watched me with painted eyes
Or from photos incandescent
Those streets today blurry, clear,
At the same time narrow and precise:
They are in the past and today I cross them,
In a sheet draped, chasing myself.
Everything is a pact of irreality:
The serenade of the rosebush of time.
I will see myself unfolded, on turning this corner
As in the Rinascente department store
One afternoon in Turin made of plaster
In the dark grisaille of the porticoes.
(Then I remembered it was carnival,
Seeing lights in the February snow.)
Hunters of the hunter,
We crouch, loggia to loggia, corner
To corner, mercury zigzag
That slips through my hands, my years.
Like a gargoyle in the Piazza Solferino,
The mask of my yesterday looks at me.
To have reached the end of the road:
The moon could linger in the end.
The poem, a mosaic of voices:
All poems are a single voice
That murmurs words wearing makeup,
The smeared eyeshadow in the voiceless light,
The wave that arriving departs.
The predella of Urbino is the shuttering
Word of Paolo Uccello:
Shadows of quicksilver, incensing light
In the muzzle of air in flames.
But the predella is not a rampart;
The heirlooms absolute word,
The waxen gloss of clarity.
All that pisses me off!JEAN GENET
Urganda the unknown? Not at all:
In a separate claim, Palma Arena,
Packages stuffed with brass and straw
And the larceny that shines in the night;
Rag-and-bone men the color of lead
And a pansy with pupils of blue.
The marauders of light
Wed not the figurines,
With the display window papered over.
The country of foams terracotta
Sees not the gold braids of sawdust,
The saturning nocturne of werewolves,
The rabble of scoundrels,
The scramble of the blue of the sky.
Joan MirÃ³ lived by this sea:
That is why we watch our words,
So as not to make peace with paper money,
With the veterinary of chemists and fodder.
Death in a Tyrolese hat
In the hills the color of hay,
Death with his vagabond eyes,
Will discover the asps of the day,
The Cleopatra in the suburb of tango
Touched with the picture hat with the plumage of toucan.
Our Homer will be Santos DiscÃ©polo
(Or perhaps he will be our Juvenal?).
The landscape has a date of expiry:
A suspension, between two wars,
A vacated instant of basil,
As well as discolored thyme,
Full sunlight with an odor of cyanide.
Flatland distant, instance annoying. 
More tiresome than fatal: landscapes
For a panoply of scrapyards.
The deadly cavalade of memories,
The pink trophy table of non-being.
Each word, bereft of meaning,
Is only the clamor of secondaries,
The hoarse caw of scrap-dealers,
An exchange of falsifications:
The rube and the ha, the gullibles fair,
Of card-sharps and number-runners, nothing more.
Death of Blas de Otero in the summer sun:
The dignity of the word on foot.
Yes, the rest is excess. The bowspirit pushes on,
Death ahead, for poetry:
Manifestly leads to the prow the eyes of living.
Alma Venus: love, revolution.
Did he spring from beneath the earth?
Did he fall off the sky?
There he was amidst the sound,
Wounded,
Badly injured,
Still,
In silence,
Fallen to his knees,
Facing the inevitable,
His veins cleaving
To fright,
To asphalt,
His long mane hanging loose,
His saintly eyes,
Naked, stark naked,
So white he was almost blue.
They maintain it was a horse.
I believe he was an angel.

Weep living tears! Weep gushers! Weep your guts out! Weep dreams! Weep before portals and at ports of entry! Weep in fellowship! Weep in yellow!
Open the locks and calas of tears! Let us soak our shirts, our souls! Inundate the sidwalks and the boulevards, and bear us along safely on the flood!
Assist in anthropology courses, weeping! Celebrate realtives' birthdays, weeping! Walk across Africa, weeping!
Weep like a caiman, like a crocodile...especially if it's true that caimans and crocodiles have no real tears in them.
Weep anything, but weep well! Weep with your nose, with your knees! Weep through your navel, through your mouth!
Weep of love, of hate, of happiness! Weep in your frock, from flatus, from frailty! WEep impromptu, weep from memory! Weep throughout the insomniac night and throughout the livelong day!
Now that you learn the gestures of emotion
and its vagueness among other gifts,
now that you remember and in those you remember
you are a vile loan, only mist and dust,
now that you conspire and greet and nurture yourself,
and long ago you accepted that soon,
soon youll be, even if you dont desire such change,
now that you prosper in your validity of man,
consider yourself likewise vacant and damned,
until kneeling you meet
the locked up, wicked turtledove of the heart.
Clinging to its head you will be free and caught
warning miracles in each one of your parts,
and then, more than in the reason
youd prefer to live with a shaking,
or a sleeping ribbon on your wrist.
Imagination is wrong,
it shows us impassive,
intangible
as spectral animals
huddling in stables,
and strictly speaking,
what it does is train us,
to put into play tactics
and tasks to intimidate
with the law of kindness,
with parables of kindness,
with that spurious lyricism of the afflicted,
and when ragged, disdained
by sunstroke and by the winters
we urge to love,
to the work of charity
as the touch of love,
on the inside we swear
on the bowed heads,
the hesitant foot,
the open hand,
they are the ordinary disguise
at thiefs first glance,
the axe of the executioner between teeth.
No bonds withhold, — for all that held are broken;
So heaven ordained, — and blessed be its name!
The bitter chalice I have drained in token,
And now is peace with nothing more to claim.
I loved thee — but no more — not even in fancy;
Never, if I have erred, the truth be said;
O'er all the dreary years in necromancy
I throw forgetfulness, — my heart is fed.
Thou hast made riot there with breast unsparing,
Struck down my pride beneath thy blows insane,
But never turned my lips reproaches bearing
To bring a charge against thy tyrant reign.
Of weighty faults, a scourge in venging hour
Thou fill'dst thy mission here — Ah, knowst it not?—
Not thine was all the irresistible power
Which left my forces conquered and forgot.
'Twas God I sought, — unto His name be glory!—
For all is over; I regain my breath.
Angel of Vengeance! Man, it was thy story;
I see and fear thee not, nor seek thy death!
Thy sceptre faller and thy sword-blade rusted,
Alas! — is this the liberty I gain?—
I made a world of thee, in thee I trusted,—
Now life around me is an empty plain
Be happy thou! If thou shouldst e'er discover
This poor adieu that I address to thee,
Know that the breast wherein thou once wert lover
Holds pardon for thee and sweet charity.
Alone it stands, an idle heap of dust,
The dreamland Arab palace on its hill;
And should Boabdil, its old lord, come still,
His grief would find an equal in its rust.
The sweet Granada spring herself doth trust
Ungrudging here, and her green charms fulfil;
The fountains play, and dream would have its will
Over the perfumes spilled on every gust.
Who in this gracious tower-retreat, remote,
Could muse an hour upon the languid charm
Of beauty and the smiling thought of love,
And find not through his drowsy senses float
Another voice that sounds the soft alarm
Of tears, as in the nightingale's full throat?
There are eyes so full of dreams
That they show us scenes of yore;
Eyes whose pensive glances pour
Light of other skies and streams;
Eyes of grief that nourish themes
Dimly seen, as from the shore
Halcyon wings that wander o'er
Broken waves and clouded gleams.
Eyes there be whose sorrows fair
Teach oblivion from the skies
To the hearts whose cross is there;
Eyes that sweet old gladness prize,
Whose ethereal cloudings bear
Stars from a lost Paradise.
Perched on its yellow peak beneath a sky
Inclement as of Africa, there lifts
Toledo, with its brows of wrinkled rifts
Crowned with the belfries of the long gone-by.
The sacred city shuts its midday eye
To take siesta 'mid the Orient wifts;
Only from out the forge the rumor drifts
Where on the sword-blade still the armorers ply.
Deep in the choir's ancient glooms, behind
The Gothic lattices, there bends in prayer
A pallid monk upon his ritual.
And on the balcony outside there wind
The garlanded carnations burning there
Fresh as the lips love's earliest sighs enthrall.
The Dawn, with orange blossoms all adorned,
apportioned half its tears to your carafe,
which was not broken in its wanderings,
nor was it pilfered by the carter's staff.
Once separated from her laughing eyes,
each tiny drop, just like a fragrant pearl,
by a seraphic bee was, faithfully,
to wandering carafe duly transferred.
Clio owes you some grapes, like salted cod;
though minimal in habit, clearly plum,
in spite of this absurd circumlocution.
You make the fists of Alexander tight,
at Hales his chapel now seems second class,
what Stephen left, left naught to disillusion.
Thundering monsignor, since when do you
hurl bolts at juveniles? I can't count up
how many plumes you had to saddle for
him who even these days bears your cup.
The Phrygian youth, of whom antiquity
his beauty praises so, should kiss the foot
of him who was for Spain splendor so great,
and scant, but fatal, now is merely soot.
Your minister, no gryphon, surely harsh,
which Steropes had forged in Lipari,
a bezoar I say of a new Peru,
the petals kindled of a fragile flower,
and not the towering Ceraunian peaks.
Oh Jupiter, oh you, it's always you!
I find I'm in the chapel and condemned
to pass from life with no hope of relief.
I rue the cause more, even, than departure,
by hunger exiled like a man besieged.
The fault is in my being so unlucky;
in my timidity, fault greater yet.
I blame myself for both as I embark,
and I will leave at least having confessed.
May the sharp steel blade adjudge my fate,
which, though it's fine edge nears, still I may see
exalted mercy from your noble hand.
Since I have told you nothing of my shame,
I'll let the lines, sir, of this sonnet be
my tongue and tears and not a vain demand.
Suspended from a timber, breast transfixed,
and having both your temples pierced with thorns,
in ransom offering your mortal pain
for us, was surely a heroic deed.
But greater was to have been born so poor,
in such a place to make us understand
that where you came and whence you had begun
no porch for roof would have the slightest need.
A greater feat this was not, my great God,
of nature for having the chill offense
conquered in tender age with sturdy breast
(more great was sweating blood than being cold)
but greater since the span is more immense
from God to man to go, than man to death.
Already kissing two crystalline hands,
already clinging to a white, smooth neck,
already scattering 'round it all that hair,
which Love from the gold in its mines had torn;
already breaking on those precious pearls
a thousand sweet words, not deserving it,
already plucking from each lovely lip
crimson roses with no fear of thorns,
was I, oh shimmering and jealous Sun,
when your light, shattering my eyes,
killed my delight and stopped what I'd begun.
If heaven has not yet become too weak,
in order that yours cease to give me pain,
may its rays kill you as they did your son.
Icarus of flannel, if of pine
a Cyclops not, huge as a colonnade,
you try to fly with wings just like a chicken,
when clearly you're on four feet like an ass?
What Dedalus in his odd way induced you
to crown with clouds the intellect itself,
if those waves, which Betis from its reefs
unlooses, will disgrace your foolish acts?
Don't give the sun more wax, for it is folly,
funereal ostrich, structure sporting wings,
nor feed the press of Europe with this scoop.
Wait for the town, where at the noonday hour
if old chef Mourning won't cloak it in batter,
chef Sweat is sure to serve it up in soup.
Less swiftly did the arrow seek
its destined mark, which it so sharply pierced;
the racing chariot on voiceless sand
did not a column with more silence round,
than swiftly runs, and surreptitiously
to its end our life. For him who doubts,
even if it's a brute of reason stripped,
every new sun a comet's warning sounds.
Carthage confesses this, yet you don't see?
You are in danger, Lycius, if you persist
in chasing shadows, grasping at a straw.
You will not soon be pardoned by the hours:
hours that erode the fabric of our days,
days that our years inevitably gnaw.
Galatea's fierce monoculous
devotee through the streets of Madrid trod,
and like crude peasants often tend to use
against a stranger all their howling dogs,
one scholar stiff, another more severe
(a mob of critics, if not pygmies) stormed,
their teeth all sharpened and their venom used
against the cyclops goatherd so deformed.
In spite of his forehead's one shimmering orb,
they blackened him; then he let loose two words --
two bolts from where the sun has never shined:
"If pedants," he responded, "really want
a new light from another hemisphere,
let them file their complaints with my behind."
Misguided, suffering, itinerant
in gloomy night, with indecisive foot
the labyrinth traversing of the wilds,
he called in vain, his steps at random took.
Repeated barking, if not close at hand,
at least distinct, he heard of wakeful dog,
and in a shepherd's cottage, poorly thatched,
compassion found, if not the way he sought.
The sun rose, and beneath her ermine cloak,
a sleepy beauty with sweet savagery
ambushed the traveler so beset with ills.
His lodging he will pay for with his life;
he'd have been better off roaming the hills
than dying in the manner that I die.
A prison for jointed mother-of-pearl
(of my own constancy a rival bright)
a diamond was, which quite ingeniously
itself in gold was caught in prison tight.
Chloris, who that her finger be oppressed
by metal, even precious, won't allow,
one day with grace, and quite impatiently,
redeemed it from its golden bond somehow.
But, oh, a sliver of deceptive brass
upon the crystals of her lovely hand
sacrilegiously divine blood drained:
crimson dye less brightly shone on Indian
ivory; enviously, upon the snow
the Dawn carnations' petals stripped in vain.
In this Occidental, in, Lycius,
this epoch, climacteric of your life,
each uncertain step will be a fall,
every easy fall a precipice.
Does your step falter? Good sense must prevail!
the wholeness of all matter falls apart.
What prudence ever clearly warned by dust
the ruin awaited of the edifice?
Not only all its skin, the deadly snake,
but with its skin its very years can shed
and man cannot. How human thought is blind!
Oh, he's a lucky man, who giving up
his heavier part to rest on silent stone
the lighter to a sovereign sapphire binds.
This in graceful form, oh wanderer,
a solid key of jasper gleaming bright
denies to all the world the softest brush
which ever wood gave soul, or canvas life.
His name, deserving even greater breath
than Fame needs for her clarions to play,
this ground of solemn marble amplifies:
revere it and continue on your way.
Here lies the Greek. To Nature he bequeathed
his Art; to Art, his skill. To rainbows, hues.
To Phoebus, lights (to Morpheus his darks).
May this great urn, despite its hard veneer,
drink tears and all the odors in the sweat
of the Arabian tree's funereal bark.
Let me go warm and merry still;
And let the world laugh, an' it will.
Let other muse on earthly things,—
The fall of thrones, the fate of kings,
And those whose fame the world doth fill;
Whilst muffins sit enthroned in trays,
And orange-punch in winter sways
The merry sceptre of my days;—
He that the royal purple wears,
From golden plate a thousand cares
Doth swallow as a gilded pill;
On feasts like these I turn my back,
Whilst puddings in my roasting-jack
Beside the chimney hiss and crack;—
And when the wintry tempest blows,
And January's sleets and snows
Are spread o'er every vale and hill,
With one to tell a merry tale
O'er roasted nuts and humming ale,
I sit, and care not for the gale;—
Let merchants traverse seas and lands
For silver mines and golden sands;
Whilst I beside some shadowy rill
Just where its bubbling fountain swells
Do sit and gather stones and shells,
And hear the tale the blackbird tells;—
For Hero's sake the Grecian lover
The stormy Hellespont swam over;
I cross without the fear of ill
The wooden bridge that slow bestrides
The Madrigal's enchanting sides,
Or barefoot wade through Yepes' tides;—
But since the Fates so cruel prove,
That Pyramus should die of love,
And love should gentle Thisbe kill;
My Thisbe be an apple-tart,
The sword I plunge into her heart
The tooth that bites the crust apart,—
Things, Celalba mine, have I seen strange:
the sundering of clouds, winds swear and shout,
high towers their foundations bend to kiss,
the earth its very bowels vomit out;
sturdy bridges break, like tender reeds,
prodigious streams, fierce rivers swelled by rain,
poorly traversed by ingenuity,
by mountains even worse their surge restrained;
the days of Noah, people perched atop
the tallest pine trees that approach the sky
the strong beech trees in their enormity.
Shepherds, dogs, herd animals and huts
I saw afloat, with neither form nor life,
and I feared nothing but my misery.
In a small patch of heaven
I saw the sun unseam,
become two shining stars
and these had black beams.
They shine and serve
as the Venus stars:
at dawn the morning star,
the evening star at night.
Their shapes rimmed in gold,
a miracle is worked:
the dark becomes fair,
not the fair dark.
Rays that are the keys
to this sea's port
if ports become a sea
all gulfs and straits.
Eyes with no such mercy—
but yet they have, look!
The rays they don in mourning
for so many lives wrecked.
Blooms of rosemary,
Isabel, love,
today are blue flowers
but honey anon.
Jealous, dear, jealous
are you of him there,
blest that you seek him,
though he's blind to your care;
thankless, he angers,
self-assured his poise,
today not disclaiming
yesterdays wrong.
Let hope wipe out
all you weep for him,
for jealousies
of those who've loved
today are blue flowers,
Dawn of yourself,
for whom pleasure's eclipsed
as you to pleasure
were about to wake;
let your eyes be still,
yield no more pearls,
for what befits daybreak
ill becomes the sun.
Dispel as if mists
all you can't view;
for lovers' suspicions
and rows that ensue
Maria, most illustrious and fair,
while now at any time you still display
in your bright cheeks the hues of rosy Dawn;
in your eyes, Phoebus; on your brow, the day,
and while with its graceful discourtesy
the wind blows 'round the swiftly flying strands
which in its veins Arabia holds dear
and the rich Tagus nurtures in its sands;
before — when Phoebus is eclipsed by time
and the bright day has changed into dark night -
Dawn flees the fatal shadows that take hold;
before that which today is treasure bright
can outdo with its whiteness the white snow:
enjoy, enjoy, the blush, the light, the gold.
I disembarked, dear aunt, in la Mamora,
where the next morning I saw in the fog
from the safe haven of my trusty armor,
all the confusion of a moorish mob.
Plumes running to the rescue all atremble
from south, and north, and from all Castille teem,
ordering, if not some veal piccata,
at least a fresh sip from an old canteen.
One soldier flattened our opponent's soil
by stretching out to sleep; another man —
a watchful sapper ever working on — he
shoveled in a sub: and in this war
the only hero I've seen yet is that one.
From La Mamora. Wednesday morning. Johnny.
While trying with your tresses to compete
in vain the sun's rays shine on burnished gold;
while with abundant scorn across the plain
does your white brow the lily's hue behold;
while to each of your lips, to catch and keep,
are drawn more eyes than to carnations bright;
and while with graceful scorn your lovely throat
transparently still bests all crystal's light,
take your delight in throat, locks, lips, and brow,
before what in your golden years was gold,
carnation, lily, crystal luminous,
not just to silver or limp violets
will turn, but you and all of it as well
to earth, smoke, dust, to gloom, to nothingness.
No vessel torn to shreds by solid rock
with more repentance ever reached the shore,
nor bird escaping from the outstretched net
did fly more fearfully into the wood;
a lovely nymph with her uncertain foot
never with such affliction or alarm
fled from green meadow, where, hidden from view,
a serpent basked 'neath nature's verdant hood,
as I, O Love, the haughty temperament,
the yellow tresses and the lovely eyes
run fleeing now, my feet no longer bound,
of my foe, whom I celebrate in vain.
Farewell, cruel nymph; with her may you remain,
hard rock, gold net, and happy meadow's ground.
Clear honor of the liquid element,
Sweet rivulet of shining silver sheen!
Whose waters steal along the meadows green,
With gentle step and murmur of content!
When she for whom I bear each fierce extreme,
Beholds herself in thee,—then Love doth trace
The snow and crimson of that lovely face
In the soft gentle movement of thy stream.
Then, smoothly flow as now, and set not free
The crystal curb and undulating rein
Which now thy current's headlong speed restrain;
Lest broken and confused the image rest
Of such rare charms on the deep-heaving breast
Of him who holds and sways the trident of the seas.
Dear lady, Mrs. Segoviana Bridge,
whose eyes are now reduced to weeping sand,
if you cry for the river, you're in luck,
though for a widow you're quite elegant.
It died of bladder blockage. In Castille
no washerwoman will not cry in grief;
your busy pleasure island's now condemned
to black elms cloaked within a mourning sheath.
It's very true that all the doctors say
that it's not dead, that in the summertime
the heat can make you faint, or sweat, or shiver;
and that when cold December comes again,
these learnèd men will make sure that their mules'
life-giving drops give health back to the river.
Its gaze filled my abyss, its gaze melted
into my being, became so mine that I
am doubtful if this breath of agony
is life still or hallucinated death.
The archangel came, cast his sword
upon the double laurel flourishing
in the sealed garden... And that day brought back
the shadow and I returned to my nothingness.
I thought the world, witnessing man's appal,
would crumble, overwhelmed beneath the ruins
of the entire firmament crashing down.
But I saw the earth at peace, at peace the heavens,
the fields serene, limpid the running stream,
blue the mountain and the wind at rest.
Polychromatic beauty—
with your oil-painted murals of primitive art,
your garlands of crepe-paper—:
you are like a fiery banderilla,
a taunt from the throat
of the people,
igniting a Sunday,
your week of tedium,
to avenge, through the sleepwalking policeman in the corner,
nearly four centuries of sorrow and silence...
He has gone
the silent road. He goes
before me. He carries his torch
clear already of the traitorous air.
He goes murmuring the verse he could not say
the last evening.
His smile died and in his eyes
the deep dread trembled of what now he knows.
I call him, follow him. He turns no more
his face to me to say: "father,
here is my youth, I give it up to you,
here is my heart, here is my blood."
When my pursuing steps, by absence quickened,
come up with him,
and we are joined before the burning glass
of time-delivered images,
I shall see his face and see his brow
sink on my breast.
There he and I shall know who sets a day
for the departing, and the journey's why.
Wring the swan's neck who with deceiving plumage
inscribes his whiteness on the azure stream;
he merely vaunts his grace and nothing feels
of nature's voice or of the soul of things.
Every form eschew and every language
whose processes with deep life's inner rhythm
are out of harmony...and greatly worship
life, and let life understand your homage.
See the sapient owl who from Olympus
spreads his wings, leaving Athene's lap,
and stays his silent flight on yonder tree.
His grace is not the swan's, but his unquiet
pupil, boring into the gloom, interprets
the secret book of the nocturnal still.
If you are a gift snatched from heaven,
why the doubts, the moans, the tears,
the jealousy, the tormenting grief,
the troubled nights of feverish wakefulness?
If you are an evil from the terrestrial globe,
why the joys, the smiles, the songs,
the hopes, the glorious enchantament
the visions of peace and consolation?
If you are snow, why your live flames?
If you are a flame, why your inert ice?
If you are a shadow, why do you spread light?
Why the shade, if you are beloved light?
If you are life, why do you give me death?
If you are death, why do you give me life?
The pleasures and glories of life
either never come or come to us too late.
They shine close up, they pass fleetingly, 
the pleasures and glories of life.
Sad is the man who in his best years
delays plucking the flowers of life!
Your eyes are saying something to me;
but what they are saying, I do not know.
Twixt mystery and blushes,
your eyes are saying something to me.
Are they flashing scorn and anger,
or do they speak of love and faith?
Write a poem: mark the skin of water.
Softly the signs
bend, grow,
tell the desires of
breeze, sun, clouds,
loose and strain themselves, until
he who sees them
—still wind
distant light—
either sees his own face
or —pure transcendence, profound
failure— sees nothing.
Sometimes the urge to weep besets me
but the sea wafts it away
¡The sea, the sea!
Within me I feel it
Just from thinking
on it —so much my own—
my thought bears a taste of salt.

Poète
sur la rive du fleuve
aux sables fauves ou sombres
la nature interprète
—ô merveille!—
(tel quà lère sanscrite ou ètrusque?)
Je mempoisonne dun souvenir.
Dans la chambrette violette, la soie,
le duvet aérien, le parfum discret
dun nard odorant et lheure rêvée...
Dans la chambrette violette lamour
muet, fervent, brûlant dans les yeux
et le suc tiéde de la bouche repue...
Te mempoisonne dun souvenir.
Dans la chambre violette, toutes nues
les formes gracieuses sur le satin vert
et enlacées á moi toutes les delices...
Quel profond silence! Ogre bienveillant
qui avale les bruits mutiles et vains...!
La parole ne jaillit pas et je vole une caresse
avec mes yeux lestes et mes agiles mains...
Alors flotte dans le sentier qui fuit au loin
un tendre parfum de lys, tel de lointains accords
de touches amorties... Quel profond silence!
Et Colombine est belle! Le jardin si obscur...
On devine quelque chose de blanc et de rond,
blanc, rond et pur...!
A Roberto Liévano
Au son de musiques dolentes

par les sentiers et par les pentes...

Vont á la chasse au népenthès

A Gregorio Castañeda Aragón
I have not seen the ocean.
My eyes
—vigilant melting, fantastic glowworms;
my eyes which watch amid the night; owners
of the starry archway;
of the astral words;
my wandering eyes;
akin to the hideous insanity of the abyss;
my eyes steeled like Vikings, observing,
my vagabond eyes
have not seen the ocean...
The undulous lyric of its quivering contour
has not stirred my dreams,
I did not hear the erotic growl of its foghorns,
nor was my sight stunned by the sparkling quicksilver
that is tossed about on its back...
Its resonant waterspouts,
its silences, I could never heart:
Its Cyclopean rages, its complaints or its hymns,
nor its intrepid muteness when silvers and golds
of the suns and moons, like perpetual weepings
dilute its riches with glaucous sapphire!
Nor shall I inhale its perfume!
I know of the aromas
of beloved heads of hair...
I know of the perfumes of slender throats
and fragile and lukewarm,
of temples where the favorite perfume censers of Venus
hide their fragances,
I shall inhale the flasks
where Nirvana kindles the symbolic sandlewoods,
the common aloes and myrrhs of the wizard Zoroaster...
But I shall not inhale the salts nor the iodines of the ocean!
My parched lips
did not put out their thirst
in | its wine skins:
not in | its tart wine skins
did they mitigate my thirst...
My lips, insane, drunk, avid, vagabond,
pensive lips
made bitter by alases and wrathful gestures
and which other lips —virgin— captured in their net.
Brother of the clouds
am I
Brother of the clouds,
of the wandering clouds, of the deluded of space:
vagrant warships
pushed by keen puffs of wind anonymous and cold,
impelled by brutal impetus fickle and sombre!
Traveler of nights
am I.
Traveler of intoxicating nights, mariner
of its boundless seas,
of its boundless seas, delirious, empty,
—empty of infinity |.., empty...— Docile mariner
And my dreams defeated warships...
Defeated warships, unknown courses, grottos
of pirates, the ocean...
My vagabond eyes
—unsatiated travelers— they know skys, worlds,
they know profund nights, unponderous and serene,
they know tragic nights,
delicius illusions, shameless dreams...
They know of unique sorrows,
of pleasures and of tears,
of myths and of science,
of hate and of mercy,
of pain,
and to love!...
my sterile eyes
my eyes have not seen the ocean,
Voilà! Voilà! Mélusine,
Voilà! Mélusine dor
—dans tes cheveux et le duvet léger
qui tombre la lèvre et les joues—.
Voilà! Mélusine de bleuet
—yeux dazur, humides et palpitans—.
Voilá! Mélusine la blonde
—tes lévres roses, ton cou rose,
et roses tes trésors cachés...
Voilà! Voilà! Mélusine
Voilà! Mélusine dor:
quand écloront les fleurs doranger?
Quand goûtera ma bouche gloutonne
la chaude saveur de tes lèvres gourmandes?
Quand donc ces trésors cachés
quá peine entrevit mon oeil affamé
(bastion aux deux coupoles petites
coupoles provocantes, décorées
dune paire de fraisettes rouges;
broussailleuses cachettes sous tes bras frais;
broussailleuses cachettes...?
Quand donc ces trésors secrets
goútera gloutonnement ma gourmandise?
Quand écloront les fleurs doranger?
—dans tes cheveux et le duvet léger...—
Voilà! Mélusine de bleuet,
Voilà! Mélusine la blonde,
Voilà! Voilà! Mélusine...

Du bleibst mir, und du schenkst die Freude mir
mit dem Schmerz, und deinen köstlichen Honig
mit der bitterherben Aloe.
Du bleibst mir, und das Licht, das deine Seele im Innern
schafft der unbeschreiblichen Finsternis
meines einsamen Ichs.
Ich rühme immer
dein gauklerisches Geschenk.
Du bleibst mir, un che helle Zauberei
deiner lachenden Augen: mit ihrem Zauber
belebst du meine Einsamkeit.
Du bleibst mir, un dein Lachen, dessen Arpeggio
mich trunken macht, und dein Schatz aus reinstem Gold,
der einsamen Seele Erquicken:
Den grauen Nebel
verklärt dein Geschenk
Du bleibst mir, und der Liebestrank, den dein brennender
fruchtiger Mund, umschattet, in meine fiebernden
ausgedörrten Lippen giesst.
Du bleibst mir, die unschuldsvoll Entflammte,
du bleibst mir, die Erfahrene, mit listigem
verfülirerischen Vorgehn:
Leben. Tod.
Was du willst.
Tes cheveux retiennent le parfum de la nuit
et tes yeux ses lueurs tourmentées.
La saveur de la nuit vibre en ta bouche palpitante.
Mon coeur est crucifié sur une nuit debéne.
La nuit reluit sur ton front hlé, altier et fragile
et sur tes bras au duvet velouté.
En des plages cachées de ton corps rôde la nuit
parfumée de nard, de vanille et cannelle...
La nuit s irise en tes yeux bruns:
bouillonnantes et vivaces constellations.
La nuit demeure en tes yeux bruns, quand tu les fermes:
nuit définitive, augurale et magique.
Dans tes oreilles toute la musique de la nuit
se réfugie et te berce en son vague murmure...
Dans tes oreilles, toute la musique de la nuit,
et dans ta voix, ton rire et tes muets sanglots...
Sur ton front son angoisse cachée erre en somnambule
et dans ton coeur anioureux ses lueurs tourmentées.
Dans la nuit ensorcelée, sorcier, je vagabonde...
Tes mains, deux lunes ples sur mon front.
Je suis cloué en toi, Ô nuit délicieuse!
Ô Nuit...! bois tiède de ma croix!
Dans quelque baie chantent-elles encore
ou existent-elles les sirènes?
Fiction de troubadour troubadourant,
fiction à peine?
Qui entendit jamais chanter ces sirènes,
et où, comment et quand?
Le vent souffle sur les plages,
la mer se brise contre les falaises
en sanglotant!
Que de nénies désolées!
Trouvère, troubadour troubadourant,
il faut que tu alignes
—et quelles foltrent dans la baie—
treize sirénes... Sera-ce assez de treize?
You shall not go for you have just come,
slight illusion of dream, dense, intense, vibrant flower.
My bold heart, for the reapings
is hard hand audacious..., for the dominion, soft.
My bold heart adrift...
You shall not go, for you are just coming.
If you go, if you left...: When you return,
you shall return even more lascivious
and you shall find me, lascivious, waiting.
To Rafael Jaramillo Arango
The memory of you glitters in my soul
like the moon on the sea...
In the still of my nights
I hear your voice whisper,
your voice telling me softly
that you don't want to forget me...
In the still of my nights,
—Like the moon on the sea—
the memory of you glitters in my soul...
I see the lambent flicker
of the stars, in your eyes.
The warm escenting of your tenebrous
tresses enraptures me...
Your forehead —a lunar miracle—
Uncovers the sheer yearnings
of your love, of your dreaming
My lonely hours pursue
your memory in a whirl
of dreams and deluded dreams
(Can't we fulfill them...?)
Melancholic illusory reverie
that justifies the vegetation
of my proud soul,
of my singular spirit...
(Can't we fulfill it...?)
The memory of you glitters in my soul...
I feel on my lips the palpitation
of the tremolous and perennial kiss
with which we will kiss each other...
I see in your eyes of mystery
—As if they were to cry...—
The entire poem of the life
which we could not fulfill...
In your nocturnal hair
—Nards and lijes and orange blossoms—
I inhale all the perfumes
with which I wish to benumb
my chimeric pantomime
of dreaming and dreaming and dreaming!
In your fair slender figure
is all the eurhythmy of rhyming...
Your pale hands
—It seems as if it was about to snow... —
Your hands, languid and frail,
a pair of incomparable lilies!
Your hands, that blessed
with its forgiveness, my ramble
on arduous dark roads
and easy ways of sin...
I hear your voice whisper...
Your voice telling me softly
That you dont want to forget me!
I feel in my hazy forehead
The touch of your mowy hands..
I feel in my ireful gelid forehead
The soothing palpitation
Of your lips, which efface guilts
and desire to forgive me.
of my incoherent ramble!
Absurd fantasy
of my singular spirit!
Ingenuous delirium that turns
—Ironic and hard— into sorrow...
That we cant fulfill...!
Like the moon on the sea...!

I gamble mylife!It wasn't worth much!I have lost ithopelessly!Erik Fjordsson
I gamble my life, I barter my life,
I have lost it
anyway...
And I gamble or trade it for the most puerile mirage,
I give it in usufruct, or I give it away...
I gamble it against one or against everybody,
I gamble it against zero or infinity,
I gamble it in a bedroom, in an agora, or in a gambling den,
in a crossroads, in a barricade, in a mutiny;
I definitely gamble it, from beginning to end,
breathwise and deepwise
—on the periphery, in the middle,
and in the underdepth...
hopelessly.
And I gamble it, or trade it for the most puerile mirage,
I give it in usufruct, or I give it away...:
or I trade it for a smile and four kisses:
all is the same to me:
whatever is eminent and base, trivial, perfect or bad...
All is the same to me:
there is roorn enough for everything in the minute horrid abyss
where my brain is knotted like a snake.
I trade my life for oid lamps
or for the dice used to gamble the seamless tunic:
—for the most anodyne, the most obvious, the most futile:
for the pendants the simian mulatto girl
hangs on her ears,
as do the Nubian terra-cotta,
the pale brunette, the yellowish oriental woman, or the hyperborean blonde:
I trade my life for a tin ring
or for Sigmunds sword,
or for the orb Charlemagne held in his hands: to let the bali go rolling. —.
I trade my life for the idiots or the saint´s
candid halo;
I trade it for the red collar
the fat Capet got around his neck;
or for the solid shower that fell upon the neck
of Charles I;
I trade it for a romance,
I trade it for a sonnet;
for eleven Angora cats
for a doggerel or a saeta,
for a song;
for an incomplete pack of cards;
for a large knife, for a pipe, for an ancient harp...
or for that doll that cries
like any poet.
I trade my life —on credit— for a factory of sunsets
(with red glows);
for a gorila from Borneo;
for two Sumatran panthers;
for the pearls swarthy Cleopatra drank—
or for her little nose that must be in some Musseum
I trade my life for old lamps,
or for Jacobs ladder or for his pottage of lentils...
or for two minute holes
—on my temples— through which in gray rotten humors flow
all the boredom, all the nuisance, ah the horror I keep in my head...!
I gamble my life, I barter my life
This rose petal was a witness
of something that if it was not love,
no other love would ever be.
This rose petal was a witness
of when I last had you!
The day I no longer know
—well, I know, but I wont say—.
This rose petal was a witness.
From your lips I heard indeed
the sweetest of all melodies.
This rose petal was a witness:
all of you was gaily smiling!
all that I ever dreamt of you
that moment I had at last...
In your eyes where night was present
that night I go ship-wrecked!
I held your body in my arms,
then I was between your arms,
then I found a warmer shelter...
I kissed your lovely mouth
where gaiety always frolicked!
of your loving agony
when I fully enjoyed love
for the first time with you!
of the moment you were mine!
Mon pauvre amour s' en est allé...
moi je resterai á pleurer...
La pluie tombe doucement,
un nuage glisse au loin...
Mon pauvre amour s'en est alié.
Loin, trés loin! en rêve
la douce aimante tissant
ses illusions que je tue...
Mon pauvre amour s'en est allé...
Qu'y a-t-il, je n'entends rien?
Quel chagrin me menace?
La piuie tombe doucement...
Un nuage glisse au loin...
La douce amante tissant
ses illusions que je tue!
Mon pauvre amour s´en est allé...
Moi je resterai à pleurer!
Amore, deiiziosa menzogna
aspro amore, addio, addio!
Edi cenere il vostro azzurro,
amore, deliziosa menzogna!...

Amore, deliziosa menzogna
aspro amore, torna, vieni!
La tua pena è lunico bene,
amore, deliziosa menzogna...
II mio cuore ebbro, delira
Il mio cuore... prendilo... tieni!
Amore, deliziosa menzogna,
aspro amore, torna, vieni.
Amore, di nuovo il suo profumo
spande nella mía schiva solitudine
Da Cipro porta a Bagdad
amore di nuovo it suo profumo...
Rinunzio ormai ad ogni atto
di simulata calma
amore, di nuovo il suo profumo
spande nella mia schiva solitudine!
For dead friends
Lady Death who goes on taking
all the good that she meets by chance!...
Alone —in a comer— left standing
the rest of us, miserable lot of troopers!
The selfish, perverse and foolish
with souls of cloth and heart of stuffing...;
manufacturers of futile verse;
poets of ruler and balance,
to all the sorrow, to each lover adverse...;
those who whisper songs of pathetic romance;
weepish fops who strut their plumes;
well versed in parlor-talk and contra-dance;
songsters of the parched summer day;
of the freezing pole or the agingWinter.
lyrists of exanimate and ridiculous souls!
Minstrels who pollute the eternal
garden, and blossoming madrigals
with somniferous and superficial smells...
Those who no wisp of truth impassions
those ultra-sensitive and banal bards...
Solemn and lethal Grammaticians...
Legerdemains of studied technique!
...Oh what perennial pain for the things
that have no flavor,—made of plastic!
...In a comer we are left, the tedious
people with no emotion, empty and vain...
Let bose the dismal and nocturnal
flies, and let the bells sing their lament...!
This boathing of which Iam dying...
Where are the intimate souls, my sisters...?
Lady Death goes on taking!
It was not easy to conduct my friendly
Relations with this table, from this chair
In which I face it now.
My work In need of hasty doingintervened, 
Or an illness left me indisposed to all
The things around me, none of which seemed pleasing
When my eyes were not already calm. 
It's fate:
But the world rubs against us all day long, 
And circumstancesof very different levels
Require an effort... of dominion. 
This chair And table, in the tranquil situation 
Of their adjustment to a quiet more
Than merely practical, at last, maintain 
The tense strength of an equilibrium
In which it's I who take the part 
Of the needed energy. 
And I who feel
The triumphant peace here now, because I hear it, 
Without even trying, in my own ears, and I
Widen it with my calm, strengthened by this
Judicious attitude of true-plumbed prudence: 
Both I and the smooth wood of the table, 
At a precise level of circumstance.
¿Qué más que el heno a la mañana verde,
Seco a la tarde?
The years, these years that I drag after me
Change from six to seven: seventy now.
Am I these sums, are they the impedimenta
That I must haul? Some destiny of the stars?
Bit by bit it darkens in this cloister
Where silence bit by bit increases;
An ashen light is throbbing in the dimness
And glowing through transparent alabaster.
Twilight is noble when it is serene.
Reflection aids me, at this perilous point,
When I can sense that all the stakes are lost.
Memory restores the thought of that green hay,
Dry at day's end. Inevitable shadow
Must helplessly advance now at my side.
Man sehnt sich nach des Lebens Bächen,
Ach! nach des Lebens Quelle hin
—Faust, i, STUDIERZIMMER
If gods no longer wait beyond the tomb
Then are the torrents of this life despoiled
By death of any final sense?
May we throw off the burden of this gloom.
Suffice it for me to cast into oblivion's
Career the wish for human dignity upheld.
Then I said Sesame. The door,
With solemn and clandestine ease,
Swung open. I was seized with fear
But nothing stopped me so in I went.
Someone bore me up inside
My heart. At a stroke I saw a room
Through crystal chandeliers the light
Shone on an unattended feast.
Paintings, mirrors, tapestries
I was alone, in an empty splendor
Reserved for one predestined here.
With that I threw myself into
The brilliant silence, a latent ripe
Magnificence at my resolve. And then...
Zu der heiligen, unaussprechlichen
Geheimnisvollen Nacht
—Hymnen an die Nacht
Oh night, pure night beneath the stars!
The firm, serene heavens illumine me
But without breaking this sweet dark
That conceals and shelters me.
Invisible to each other, men
Yet see company in the constellations,
Which tremble only if we contemplate them
Through an atmosphere criss-crossed
With our own uneasy worries.
Pure night,
So clement to the eye, though terrible
Across spaces, the far remotest spaces
In solitudes so empty
As long as consciousness, the glance of a quick
Attention, does not enlighten them.
And within this calmwhich I too maintain
To the rhythm of the multitude of planets
The night arises where we all,
Alone and yet united, form
An incomprehensible sovereign
League of the tiny.
God or the universe, eternal.
Night!
Poppies like... No.
Never either 'blood' or 'fire'.
Wild red petals,
Indescribable. Are they not unique?
The name indicates the flower.
Those poppies, those:
Poppies, poppies.
Morning, clear morning!
If I could be your lover.
Along your shore, step by step,
I'll be the one who loves you more.
My word is drawn hastening
Toward all your loveliness.
Down our path we walk.
Let me understand the way you speak.
That such delicate beauty can hover
Next to the blade of the abyss!
The scent of the true world
Comes from the blue-petaled rosemary.
Is the mallow the mistress
Of such a stony retreat?
The cricket sings without stopping.
Such patience! I humble myself before him.
And the bee leaves such delight
To the blossom he bores in!
He dives in, he does not
Give up, despite the heat of mining for gold.
The cricket speeds up his song.
Can there be more of spring?
Who loses this, is himself lost.
But this green field is surely meant for me!
Heavens whose great size
The eye cannot seizeyou are conquered by love.
Do I not deserve such a morning?
Of itself, my heart wins this prize.
Clarity, highest power:
My soul will be perfected here.
The bar on the corner wedged
between two very crowded streets,
and the deafening din of traffic
speeds up the hour
that in the bar it's two, three
runs so fast no one notices:
pastimes, business, see you later,
news from the race track,  hello...
and life slips smoothly past,
mortal, persistent, short.
Horses.
Slowly slowly lifting into the air,
will they fly perhaps?
The atmosphere becomes gray,
How much more solid now
the denser gray!
Slowly and with cautious touch
the legs unfold
advancing across
an evening sky with moon.
Unswerving the heads, noiseless,
more and more withdrawn into silence,
the manes still motionless
backs outstretched,
the horses ascend.
Will they fly perhaps with no tremor of wing
at the moon's pace?
And without touching the clumsy earth
the feet keeping time
—to what music?—
hover celestial
by virtue of mysterious abandon.
Or by virtue of caution?
No longer needed, the riders yield
—what use are bridles now?—
to the smooth sonambulant steeds.
Lured by darkness, they
lean again toward the earth,
barely grazing it at last
without breaking the wonder,
rebounding, flying off to the endlessly
fascinating expanse.
The horses move onward not looking.
And one stumbles.
With supreme sinuous courtesy
it touches, falls, curls,
curves toward the dark,
races on immersed in silence!
The eyes show more white.
The steelier grays
disperse
over the motionless torpor of the world.
Behind woeful barricades
blotches of crowds
with their crude dark murmurs
fade away.
The horses ascend, descend, tread,
tread on a point, move on,
blindly with utter accuracy,
more and more quietly, floating, light,
passing, slipping.
How skillfully the sidereal grays
mesh,
how artfully the phantoms
become
automatons of the sky,
spirits—stars in their trance
unhurried, secure!
Unhurried entirely?
That passion for slowness now,
is it not yet quick?
was it not already quickness?
Quickness in obvious seconds,
visible and tangible,
that stop the gyrations
of before
in that center of the whirlwind:
Corpuscles, seconds, sandstone
of the slowest compact reality.
Grace of such cherished tranquillity!
Spirit at last,
the animals hover
over gentle meadows.
There below the obstacle
over the dark earth.
Silence. Murmurs of the crowd
from cornices and branches
will disappear.
In the spacious grasslands insects
will hush,
and iron foliage
will have forged itself alone.
Some flower there
will unfurl its petals to the full.
How slow in becoming!
Gallop, horses, gallop.
Implacable, elegant,
the calm endures.
So many unfailing exquisite props
behind haste!
Enfolding in its gray,
patience roams
among the corpuscles of the sphere,
extends its net
over the slow sheltered zones.
Among numberless seconds
they hide, then reappear,
the stellar bodies
—and those horses alone—
above alone over the panorama.
Hint of hooves, light and polished
pieces of stone!
Soaring through the skies
go stellar horses.
Horses?
There appears and rises, alone
Without breaking the silence of darkness
A sound with form: 'candlestick'.
Vague silver barely lit
Like the nebula on a night
Of visible immensity.
I pronounce the word 'candlestick',
And it takes shape, its stable heaviness
Becomes definite. I make out: a candlestick.
Where am I going? I make an effort
From this awkward shore of an insomnia
Reduced to darkness,
To relate, to communicate now
With something which, in its own way accompanying me
Is now outside of me.
'I need you, world.'
The word and its bridge
Carry me truly to the other shore.
Across the darkness
Help me, my friend, candlestick.
I saw no soul in torment roving round
The castle walls. Then I perceived a slight
Glittering movement as a rat that joined
My scene ran through a bar of light.
The moon preferred some battlements, one ray
Became the finger in the ring
Of a love so brave, of such simplicity,
That to the future's gold it bound its link.
That rat, pastless and primitive,
Led me back to a time with ghosts,
With errant princes inconsolably sad.
And the rat scuttered through the light from above,
From tragedy and kings. You understand
Me well, moon: in my watch, all coexists.
On the branches whiteness
Standing erect. What shrub?
Flower toward me. I pull it off,
Fatally I pull it off. I am my pleasure
This flower smells of...
Jasmine?
It isn't.
Whiteness?
Perhaps.
I remember the attack of this almost sourness
Sharp like a taste.
A taste or smell. And a faithful name. Maybe...
Yes, syringa! Perfect: in its name it becomes bare.
Here is the deepest part of the night.
Feel no alarm, for enclosed within the dark,
You will submit to its brief power
In a silence without horror or enigma
That rejects the bogeyman, but submits to the charm.
I look back toward the distant years
So far, the long perspective gives
The cloudy image in the mirror
Such a narrow frame, it scarcely lives.
And yet, around the towers, the swifts
Still soar and dive, and there, on high,
My pensive early years persist.
My old vineyards give me good wine today.
Of fortune, good or bad, I have no hint.
For now, I grasp the present; though I know
What I know, I do not stint my verve.
The future, meanwhile, I observe
Diminishing for me, with delicate grace,
More difficult, more fragile, and more scant.
Whites, pinks. Blues almost in stripes
Withdrawn, mental.
Points of latent light show signs
Of a secret shadow.
But the colour, betraying the shadow,
Materializes into a mass.
Lying in the summer of the house,
A form is lighting up.
Clarity brought to life between outlines
Of such pure repose,
Which cut and erase with their lines
The base confusion.
The flesh is bare. Its evidence
Is resolved in repose.
Just sameness, prodigious
Height of presence.
Immediate fullness, without surroundings,
Of the female body,
No excellence, neither voice nor flower. Destiny?
Oh absolute Present!
The air sweetens,
Through clarity bestows more space,
Master, when that lyre
Sounds which to your Horace
Was not more true, nor gave more fame to Thrace.
You heard the concord
Reserved for your soul in the utter
Silence of the stars,
Or you shared music, in a peaceful
Moment with your friends.
All is number, silent or sounded.
Pythagoras and Plato guide you
Through their harmonies.
And above, Christ,
The Center, no longer suffering.
The suffering one is you, below,
In your daily fray
With the pedant's strict frown,
With the grim hypocrite,
Through cloisters of an envy
Which transforms your colleagues into
A surrounding, devouring plague.
So many colleagues beneath the spheres!
Those essential numbers, which you hear
Among the subtle theologians
Always struggling hand to hand
With evil and its masks,
Will never be abolished.
Does the idiot torment you,
Does the dullardso robust!sadden you?
All the senseless jabber
Ends in silence.
A silence, smooth and plain, from which
The music springsmusic of mental
Ciphers, or of the stars,
Or of the sacred rebeck.
And there will be no confusion,
Although it tears
Cruelly at your entrails,
That does not at last remain immersed in the world,
The great world that embraces all
Filth, flowers, the good poem,
The ceaseless swirling rabble
Of Creation, in creation.
Oh life Everlasting even here!
The air sweetens. An unaccustomed light.
The foliage comes together in a branch
And only over its top
The penetration of the breeze
Exercises visible dominance.
The branch of springtime is
Unfolding itself. Now the flower
Is starting to acquire colour
Slowly. Just pinkish?
No, no. The flower is getting impatient,
It wants to fulfill its name: lilac.
Porque mi corazon de trovar non se quita
From the hubbub in which I wander, lost,
A rhythm disentangles itself for me,
And yielding wholly to this new allure,
I come upon the clarity of the terrace
My guide here is the one who with clear strokes
Traces the coherence that lets me free
Myself from the goblin of disorder, so much
More melancholy than the threat of silence.
At the height of this obsessive reverie
The words, determined now to come to light,
Converge for me in a bright totality.
The sounds give me the sketch of flesh and bone.
The life-preserving boon that saves me is the form.
My pains, my sorrows, throw themselves into the flame.
I want to sleep and lean over
without moving toward the darkness.
But the mind is a path
that pierces every wall.
The infant sun is rising.
I hear the trot of a horse.
Spans of a bridge open.
Not wanting to seek I find.
The horse has left me
going  its way, so alien.
I don't listen. The noise unleashed
by the light grazes me.
Sleep, rest, toil.
Horse, car, bell.
Living is not dreaming. What if
I invent my window.
Now the horse is thought. 
It trots inside me and trots outside.
The window gives a breath
of a real invasion.
Friends. No one else. The rest is wilderness.
But theyhumane, free, idly indolent!
A love that neither promises nor swears
An oath will reunite some men
In the open air, to save themselves with air.
For words are what they want, words and a shore,
That's all: a tranquil bend
In the river's clear, pervading green.
How leisure, soul and riches
Will slip by, vagabonds across the hours!
Daybreak. The horizon
Opens its eyelashes
And begins to see. What? Names.
They are on the patina
Of things. The rose
Is today still
Called rose, and the memory
Of its passage, haste,
Haste to live more.
Through long love let that
Sour thrust of the Moment
Raise us up, so agile
That once it reaches its goal
It hurries to impose an Afterwards.
Alert, alert, alert,
I will be, I will be.
And what of the roses? Eyelashes
Closed; final
Horizon. Perhaps nothing?
But the names remain.
The torrential rain
has stopped. The plaza's
noisy Sunday ricochets
among the many faces gathered
beneath the tall laurels
laden with crepuscular
commotion. So many birds
chattering, dominating everybody,
latest conquistadors,
O, Cortez, of Cuernavaca!
Night displaces the meadow,
gray blue on black. Sudden flare
of a bright yellow-green point made pale
by such quick flight
that it is now barely life
when it vanishes, darkens toward
a seeming near extinction.
From my shadow I  sense
the beauty which is light of that instant
brief, happy, mortal: lover's lightning flash.
The garden is flowering around
The one dying alone
And discovers under the sun
The stamens piling up,
Withered the centre that was
So intimate. At its hour,
Submissive to the spring,
The rose is dying.
And all in war with 
Time for love of you—
If love, now, is the sum of my every day, 
A continuous world which will not tolerate
Velleities of return to that first Void
Before Being that does not know defeat;
If every dawn dies for the color scarlet
Through what ungoverned accidents does spring,
Fatally safe and certain of its power
To impose its light on us tomorrow, change?
But now a desert crunches suddenly
Underfoot, sprouts its thorny flower.
Dryness and distance and bleak emptiness.
And meanwhile, by a straight and certain course,
Without a backward slip, just as before,
The river spills itself into the sea.
To leave at last, to brilliant
Sea-spray and hosannahs
With a knowing expectancy,
Irrevocable impulse
To glide through the golden air
Of summer
Give thanks!and then
To set the joyful skill
Of musclesin a sudden
Access of instinctagainst
The waves; and fearlessly,
Fearlessly to fling All luxuries and cries
Across the central dawn
Of a paradise, to drown
In a plenitude and be
Reborn, utterly clear
Gusts from virgin spaces,
Unheard-of harmonies
Happy, speedy, astral,
Nimble, and alone!
When space without contour concludes
with
in a cloud,
its vast indecision gone adrift,
-Where the shore-;
while the rivers curving course
life goes on
seeking in twists and turns, sketching
its
outcome,
while the hard green water
disavows its fish
beneath the deep ambiguous reflection
of
a tremulous breeze...
when morning guides its slow
thanks to the rhythmic wakes
among the fronds,
aided by the sinuous onrush
that synchronizes
the smooth undulation of the sky
above its wind 
with the swift swish of the bubbles
Sliver of spring between the oars
of the boatmen!
The sea is murmuring greatness.
A black spot in the water?
I guess at the head
Of a seal. It's not being forged
By my imagination, which never initiates.
Undulation of waves
On the back of a seal.
Have I found what I brought with me?
Language is now touching
Reality with its power
It is a daisy
That has fifteen petals,
Groups of three by three
With bluish underside,
And toward the sunlight,
Extended, wide open,
It directs its energy.
And from afternoon on,
When the shade begins,
The flower starts folding up
Closed by the night.
Nature. A marvel. Without a lesson.
Deathit's not for you that I live.
Must I, expecting you already,
Choke on little
Anxieties breath by breath?
Wait.
Only once,
And all at once!
Wait, you.
See how a man will pursue,
Through the summer air,
More of summer, another ardor?
I am alive: I seek that treasure.
The sky dreams clouds for the real world
with matter enamored of light and space.
Today dunes scatter over a reef,
sands with marine waves that are snows.
So many chance crossings, by fanciful caprice,
there in plain view with an irresistible
smiling reality. I dwell on the edges
of solid transparent depths.
The air is enclosing, displaying, enhancing
the leaves on the branch, the branches on the trunk,
walls, eaves, corners, pillars:
Calm proof of the evening,
requiring a windows tranquil vision.
Details chime with their surroundings:
smooth pebbles, there a fence, then a wire.
Every minute finds its own aureole,
or is it fancy dreaming this glass?
I am like my window. I marvel at the air.
Beauty so limpid, now so in accord,
between the sun and the mind! There are polished words,
but I would like to know as the June air knows.
The poplar's stirring makes a visible breeze,
in a circle of peace the evening encloses me,
and a soaring sky adapts to my horizon.
This never-ending everyday life! 
It is your luck to be this way, 
And between being born and dying 
Day by day you give yourselfyou illumine
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...
They all abet
The one who threads his way through hours
That are problematic yet
Continuous, linked like a rosary.
Precarious dominion!
One fights
To set one's feet upon the earth,
To be the real point on the curve
That draws our creaturely ambition 
Toward distant spaces,
Where we want to touch
All rippling surfaces, the wrinkles
Of an immediate reality,
One therefore difficult and harsh
(Harsh from its own strength)
Which my two hands subdue at last
From habit to habit.
A life
So everyday! Without apology.
"What do I have that makes you seek my friendship?"
Could that Prime Mover
Notice me
Me, so diminutive,
Among infinite beings
Of time and space?
Humbly, I feel myself unworthy
Of attracting its attention.
Does it need me?
This question echoes and overwhelms me.
I shall not interpose the ambition of a proud man.
Would the Prime Mover need
Hymns, praise, prayers,
My eulogies in particular,
Echoing in such enormous spaces?
How can I make the Prime Mover hear me?
And I, with such a little voice... I know nothing.
Happy is he who achieves or who hopes for such a thing.
Would the Creation be a preliminary
Transition, an insufficient handmaid?
Without place, without time, what is man?
Is the splendid material universe
Gradually transforming
Its energy into a vortex of spirit,
To end up as a chorus of ghosts
With the useless stars no longer needed?
And me at the end at a meeting of spectres?
My blood is always waiting. It is what sets time and place.
In the dark knowingly, it wants more, it wants love.
I'm nothing without you, world.
This is the burnished golden cup,
all full, all flowery...
This is the cup: youth.
Let's drink the golden wine soon...
Maybe tomorrow we'll meet
among the boards of a coffin!
Table-talk. Good jokes and speeches.
I devour a dish of peaches
over your snoring pug-dog, 'Probe'.
Here's a portrait of the duchess
now and then worshipped by Duke Job.
Not the Villasana countess,
nor the wench whose scarlet flounces
broke Prieto, slyly drawn;
not the knobbly-footed maid,
not one Micoló portrayed,
dreaming of dandies, passion's pawn:
My little duchess, who adores
me, lacks a great lady's airs and graces;
she's the grisette of Paul de Kock.
She doesn't dance Bostons, and ignores
the high delight of going to the races
and the joys of le five o 'clock.
Lovelier dream than any bard had
celebrated round the globe,
or cherubim that Jacob studied:
such is the cheeky green-eyed redhead
Out and about, she treads deep pile,
goes through Swan & Brown in style,
'moddomed' by Madame Pontoon.
Not that she's investing there:
chez some other couturiére 
she's expected, sharp at noon.
My little duchess has no objets 
d'art, she's sensational, she's frabjous,
she's va-va-voom, she's rooty-toot:
there is no dame á la mode in France
matches her chassis for élégance,
even chez Mme Héléne Kossut.
Nowhere, from La Sorpresa's
entry
to the steps of the Jockey Club,
is there a Spanish, French, or Yankee
lass of such dazzle, dash and duende
as the duchess of Duke Job.
Drumming heels along the tiles!
Flashing figure that beguiles
with a marked undulación!
Blueblood's air as she surveys
passing men; she pouts with grace
worthy of Mimí Pinsón.
If some wheedling oaf waylays her,
she keeps shopping, my duquesa,
lithe as lynx or zebra foal.
Woe betide if she lets fly,
biffs him one above the eye
with avenging parasol!
There's no woman fine as she.
Spanish instep, bel esprit 
sparkling-fresh as Veuve Clicquot;
wasp-waist, smooth skin fit to fly,
cherry lip, cute 'college' eye:
eyes that say Louise Théo.
Nimble, rapid, pearly-white,
fine silk stockings drawn on tight,
lacy throat, neat-latticed back;
nose so small, so spruce and trim;
ringlets on the collar's rim,
nodding, ruddy as cognac.
Two green eyes go tango-dancing:
nothing can be more entrancing
than her nose's pert retroussé!
Empress, you'd give up your page
to compare, for looks and age,
with my white and silky pussy.
You've not seen her wield the comb,
when the royal ringlets come
tumbling on la rose épaule!
You've not heard the joyful note
trilled, when on her arms and throat
thick and fresh the soapsuds fall!
Sundays! Carefree, negligée,
she delights in sounds of day,
undisturbed till nine or ten.
While the maid is out at Mass,
with what joy the lazy lass
frowsts in rosy counterpane!
Little cap to hide the tresses,
lacy-white; two laundered dresses
poised above the long-backed seat;
high boots' pointed tips, well-glossed,
peep at bedside, blithely tossed,
jettisoned by tiny feet.
Up she bounds all feather-light
from her bed. So svelte and white
on the horsehair! Not for millions,
not for bride of lordly race
could I ever trade such grace,
nor for sweethearts at cotillions.
Now I ring: she's dressed, to admit
me for lunch. We gaily eat
pair of eggs and perfect steak.
Picturesque Chapultepec!
Rich wine, one demi-bouteille
sends our carriage on its way.
Nowhere, from La Sorpresa's entry
From the hurricane the dark wings
go enraged over the abyss ,
As funereal crowns laying down,
White foams on the black sea.
They come as much to my memory,
my cool hours of my young age,
With the present restlessness they looks fuzzy,
Like the foam and the horror of the sea.
Vision of light! love first and pure,
Goblet of syrup that I threw disloyal!
On this night that saddens my soul,
You are the foam that illuminates the sea.
Perfumes come from my native soil
Clover, roses, violas, orange blossom.
And from that mysterious flower of air
Which is like white foam from the sea.
On the beach of the immense river I feel
Running swiftly the fierce sorrel,
Bathed the breast in silver foam,
Like the foam that the sea lifts.
Mother and sisters who mourn my absence,
I will step on your desert threshold:
He is the hateful tyrant of my country
Slight foam that swallows the sea.
Before my window four roads meet.
They called from east, west, south and north,
And into the royal night to greet
The call my vagrant dreams rushed forth.
Yearning by every path to move,
My baffled heart could follow none,
Forever with the moon in love,
With what is dead or what is gone.
Four tempting roads for phantasy,
Beneath the flowers and warbled odes...
Oh, would that my poor heart might be
Perfume diffused o'ver all those roads!
A night of rain. A perfume sad
Exhales from the moistened ground.
My pensive heart, with fragance come
From thee, was wrapped around.
Beneath the shade, thy glance so full
Of understanding deep,
That used to fall like music soft
Upon my dreams in sleep.
A rainy night. With the voice of the rain
Thy voice conjoined would come,
A loving cradle song to soothe
Old yearnings for my home.
Good night. What tenderness, so full
Of pity and of grief untold,
Thy hands gave me, as we took leave,
Thy little hands, ice-cold!
Amid the dreaminess of even
The doleful song expires.
Thy touch upon the ivory keys
A dream of gold inspires.
I ponder: Thy lips never shall
Be mine, and o'er the deeps
Serene of sadness in my soul
Careless abandon sweeps.
The wind obscure scatters the leaves,
And over the sleeping fields
Autumn sheds in silence deep
That spell of wonder wields.
An evening countryside. A voice
On the highway fades away.
From lifeless pools a silence deep
And pensive seems to stray.
Near where we stand, the water tells
A secret. 'Tis a thread,
A river, with the infinite
Reflected in its bed.
The toads sing, and a cricket still
His litany prolongs.
If only one could kiss my hands
That, moving the warm, red gold
Of the branches, waken up the flights
On the wild birds they hold!
Cape jasmines. Night is all suffused
With meditations gray.
About me, pure and sad the scents
Of impossible jasmines play.
Thy snow-white thoughts, like perfume, charm
My sadness all away.
Cape jasmines. And the night is filled
The perfume still is telling me
What thou didst never say.
The whoremother of my poetry
frigid and virgin and hot
cuckolding me to show my lot
tightening her thighs competitively
doesn't free in me what I'd desire:
her irreverent beauty's bloom
her constantly throbbing center's fire
enveloped in flames and scalding dew
She deceives me on every stoa
with Rilke Vallejo and Pessoa
she sketches out my destiny
Devout agnostic lady of impiety
who in her mirror lipsticks me
she's whoremother of my poetry
The 20th century walks toward the gallows
blindfolded
It's the last night of the year 2000
They've taken the blindfold off
but now it sees less than before
The double-beat of the drums begins
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
The final stroke of the clock
falls on its neck like a guillotine
Its head lies in a basket
with a shout frozen on its face
The new century leaps into the basket
and says: Mama I'm hungry
The head nurses it with its blood
My love
many things
could have happened in August
but will not happen
many fireflies
could have shone in your eyes
but will not shine
and the month of August will be buried
without pomp or circumstance
without flowers or processions
like so many days
that never got to be trees
like so many trees
that never got to be birds
like so many birds
that never got to fly
Will you remember me when I die?
Will you remember the face you had
when you lived in my flesh and I
was home to your rights and days?
Freed from space and from time
when exactly will you miss me?
and where will you remember keenly
love with its honey and its venom?
Soul that dissolves into the all
when lost in what's measureless
you dream about me I'll be ashes
Yo will miss my mud heart
and unashamed and humble you'll yearn
to be fragile matter again
As all of life's bad days pass
these days will also pass
Winds that blast you will still
and your open wound will heal
The errant soul will come back home
What was lost yesterday will turn up too
The sun will be conceived unstained
and will rise within you again
How could I, you'll say, facing the sea,
sunk, compassless, and lost on my trip,
arrive, sails torn, at my home quay?
And a voice will say: You don't know why?
The wind that smashed your ships
is the one that makes the seagulls fly
You come out of the shower
and dry your body with my towel-like skin
And something's pushing you to rub yourself to rub yourself
between your damp thighs
You go into a dreadful frenzy
into a deathlike madness
till another dampness denser than water
soaks your flesh with its sticky honey
and you open your legs and moan and shriek
and I lick you all over with my tongues made of thread
Winters drags its legs in the snow
and never gets to the exit door
Trees disheveled
like Francine at eight a.m.
Spring pecks the egg from inside
but doesn't manage to break the shell
Like a cup of steaming coffee
I exhale puffs of fog
I will never be older than I am this winter
The river sleeps in its icy bed
as if waiting for the Last Judgement
If I had to return home
where would I go?
The cementery is covered with snow
The gravestones barely show
as if the dead still
want to tell us their names
Nothing flows or falls now
Eternity has found its place in the world
Gorée Island, Senegal
This devil's place that wasn't built by demons
but by men like us
civilized enlightened the flower and cream of the West
The sea onto which the Door of the Voyage With No Return
is not the sea of liberty is not the sea of the infinite
This is the perversion of the sea
From here the ancestors of Martin Luther King
Rosa Parks Duke Ellington Toni Morrison left
They were seized tortured chained
by flesh-and-blood fates that wove their destinies
with barbed wire
The Pope's died
and every television set in the world
is giving the news
Now we see the body being moved
across the rooms of the Vatican
I know you
would have liked to see all that mama
and you would have been moved
and you would have followed the broadcast
from your bed
And the remains of the Pope
were carried from the chapel
to St. Peter's Cathedral
But you
we had to lower to the building's basement
in a wheelchair
because the casket wouldn't fit in the elevator
In these moments
the thousand million Catholics
there are in the world
express their grief for the Pope's death
but the sum of all that grief
can't compare
to the grief your children felt
when they carried you by wheelchair
and put you in your casket
The fact that I'm talking to you now
even though you can't respond to me
tells me you aren't dead
that you're somewhere in the universe
listening to me
because existing can't be something so poor
as living stuck inside a body
that turns into rubbish that turns into ashes
I remember when I was a child
and had nightmares about the devil
I ran to get in your bed
and sometimes now mama I'm very afraid
and don't want any more fear
I want the whole universe to be like a great bed
I can get into when I'm afraid
and you're beside me though I can't see you
Our ship has smashed against the reefs
We tried to cross through the Cape of Good Hope
but the rudder started spinning crazily
Now hanging onto a beam I float adrift
The salt and the sun burn my eyes
and my lips are cracked
The stars that guide the sailors
don't know where to guide me
The waves cast my body up on a desert island
There's no fruit here that can calm my hunger
no water that can shake my thirst
I write your name in the sand and the wind erases it
I walk around naked talking alone
counting the nights with my fingers
And each day from the highest rock
I check the horizon and the movement of the tides
To see if the sea's returning your body to me
to see if the sea is pitying me
Day after day today goes away
another day's scarcely present
they can't be measured: and what's today
is fragile fleeting and evanescent
The day born when the sun first rose
was barely alive had not even blinked
when suddenly it had to close
those eyes that had just begun to blink
When the last present passes away
and we're near journey's end the last
port before the clock's time leaves
the mind will ask if there's a way
the dead might find a kind of time
that's woven and never unweaves
Now that Nietzsche has decreed God's death
and God has proclaimed Nietzsche's death
what remains for us
we who are neither gods nor prophets
we who don't announce anybody's death
and go on getting  by
The death of the gods or the death of the prophets
does not bother us
What worries us is the night all around us
The insect standing on that rock
has known me since I was a child
At dawn and nightfall his elytra salute me
Another insect is sitting on a leaf
dangling his feet
Another floats on his back in a little stream
satisfied like a bishop in a cask of brandy
The insect on that rock
doesn't have wings but flies doesn't have eyes but sees
doesn't have hands but writes letters
to the other insects
Thou who, in accent of disdain profound,
Beholding man in all his littleness,
Declared: "Life is a shade, a dream, no less
For all the fantasy in living found!"
When shone thy luminous star o'er Spanish ground,
O Sun refulgent of our Stage, confess,
Did any doubt of genius e'er oppress
Thy mind of its own inspiration's bound?
From Tiber unto Manzanares, lo,
From Rhine to Andes, universal shrines
And homage to your masterpieces, show;
Thy name to such eternity has grown,
That it should teach thee to amend thy lines:
"All is a dream, except my fame alone".
(Rabindranath Tagore's ideas)
Where did I come from, mother?
Where did I come from to you?
—You came from my dreams,
from how much I loved and felt.
As a scared bird
waiting the new sun,
you were hiding
here in my heart.
You were in the games
of my happy childhood,
and on the altars
as a deity I saw you.
Oh mysterious charm,
wonder of love:
hold in my arms
best treasure in world!
When yet was burning in my fervid veins
The fieriness of youth, with many a tear
Of grief, twas mine of all my feelings drear,
To pour in song the passion and the pains;
And now to Thee I dedicate the strains,
My Wife! when Love, from youths illusions freer,
In our pure hearts is glowing deep and clear,
And calm serene for me the daylight gains.
Thus lost on raging seas, for aid implores
Of Heaven the unhappy mariner, the mark
Of tempests bearing on him wild and dark;
And on the altars, when are gaind the shores,
Faithful to the Deity he adores,
He consecrates the relics of his bark.
The wearying summers burning heat
Is now assuaged; for from the North
The winds from frost come shaken forth,
Midst clouds oer Cuba rushing fleet,
And free us from the fevers wrath.
Deep roars the sea, with breast swelld high,
And beats the beach with lashing waves;
Zephyr his wings in freshness laves,
And oer the sun and shining sky,
Veil-like, transparent vapours fly.
Hail, happy days! by you oerthrown
We see the altar, which mong flowers
May reard to Death: attendant lowers,
With pallid face, vile Fever lone,
And with sad brilliancy it shone.
Both saw the sons, with anxious brow,
Of milder realms approaching nigh,
Beneath this all-consuming sky:
With their pale sceptres touched, they bow,
And in the fatal grave are now.
But their reign oer, on outspread wing,
To purify the poisond air,
The north winds cold and moisture bear;
Across our fields they sounding spring,
And rest from Augusts rigours bring.
Oer Europes gloomy climates wide,
Now from the North fierce sweeps the blast;
Verdure and life from earth are past:
With snow man sees it whelmd betide,
And in closed dwellings must abide.
There all is death and grief! but here,
All life and joy! see, Phbus smile
More sooth through lucid clouds, the while
Our woods and plains new lustres cheer,
And double spring inspires the year.
O, happy land! his tenderest care
Thee, favourd! the Creator yields,
And kindest smile: neer from thy fields
Again may fate me fiercely tear!
O, let my last sun light me there!
How sweet it is to hear the rain,
My love! so softly falling thus
On the low roof that shelters us!
And the winds whistling oer the plain
And bellowings of the distant main.
Fill high my cup with golden wine;
Let cares and griefs be driven away;
That proved by thee, my thirst to stay,
Will, my adored! more precious shine,
So touchd by those sweet lips of thine.
By thee on easy seat reclined,
My lyre how happy will I string;
My love and countrys praise to sing;
My blissful lot, thy face and mind,
And love ineffable and kind!
Night reigns; in silence deep around
Dreams whirl through empty space;
Clothing with her pure light the ground,
The moon shows bright her face:
Soft hour of peace; without a trace
Of Man, where rise these heights uphurld,
I sit abandond of the world.
How Natures quietude august
Delights the feeling mind,
That heeds her voice, and learns to trust
Its joys with her to find!
Sweet silence! here I rest reclined,
With but the rivers murmurings heard,
Or leaves by gentle breezes stirrd.
Now its repose on languid wings,
Its freshness Night supplies;
To shaded heaven which faithful clings,
And blaze of daylight flies:
Unseen by that, mysterious lies
On mount and plain, to please though sad,
Still beauteous evn in horrors clad.
How is the ecstatic soul impressd
With melancholy thought!
The lovely picture here possessd
Sublime with sadness fraught!
How more its music to be sought,
And peace, than all that may entrance
The echoes of the noisy dance.
Around the proud saloon reflect
Each face the mirrors there;
With diamonds, pearls, and gold bedeckd,
Light dance the gentle fair;
And with their witching grace and air,
Oer thousand lovers holding sway,
Their vows and plaudits bear away.
Lovely is that! I one day too,
When childhood scarce above,
Through balls and banquets would pursue
The object of my love.
And from the young beloved I strove,
As magic treasure, to obtain
A passing look, or smile to gain.
But now by cares subdued, and bound
By languor and disease,
Than gilded halls, these plains around
Me more the night hours please:
To the gay dance preferring these,
The calm asylum they supply,
To meditate beneath this sky.
O! ever shine on me the stars,
In a clear heaven as now!
And as my Maker that avers,
There let me turn my brow.
O! God of heaven, to Thee I bow!
And raise by night my humble strain,
The voice of my consuming pain.
Thee, also, friendly Moon! I hail;
I always loved thee dear:
Thou, Queen of heaven! me neer didst fail,
In fortunes fair or drear,
To guide, to counsel, and to cheer:
Thou knowst how oft, to enjoy thy ray,
I chide the blaze and heat of day.
Oft seated on the wide sea-shore,
Whose waves reflected thee,
To muse alone, thou smiling oer,
I passd the night hours free;
And midst my clouded hopes to see
Thy face serene, I found relief,
In sweet complaint to pour my grief.
For throbs, alas! my breast with pain,
Consumptions wounds to bear;
And pales my cheek, as thou must wane
Beneath the mornings glare.
When I shall sink, grant this my prayer,
That thy light neer to shine defer,
On thy friends humble sepulchre.
But, hark! what dulcet notes arise
The neighbouring woods among?
Causing these tender thoughts and sighs
My lonely breast to throng.
Sweet Nightingale, it is thy song!
I always loved thy wood-notes wild,
Like me from sorrow neer beguiled.
Perish whoeer for thy soft note
Seeks thee to oppress or take.
Why rather not like me remote,
Thee follow through the brake,
Where these thick woods our shelter make?
Fly free and happy round thy nest;
Enslaved I wish none, none oppressd.
Night, ancient goddess! Chaos thee
Produced before the sun;
And the last sun tis thine to see
When the worlds course is run;
And the Lord wills his work undone!
Hear me, while this lifes breath is raised,
By me thou shalt be loved and praised.
Before time was, in Chaos vast
Thou laid perhaps mightst view
Thy coming beauties, as forecast
Thy destined glories grew:
Looking thy veil of shadows through
With face obscured, to meditate
Calm on thy future power and state.
Thou camest, O Queen! from Oceans bars
At the Creators voice,
With sceptre raised, and crownd with stars,
And mantle glittering choice;
And bade the silent world rejoice,
To see through space thy brow severe
Shine with the kind moons silvery sphere.
How many high truths have I learnd
Beneath thy solemn shade!
What inspirations in me burnd
Mid the woods silence laid!
In thee I saw sublime displayd
The Almightys power, and seized my lyre,
And fervid dared to Heaven aspire.
Great Goddess, hail! in thy calm breast
Let me soothe every care!
Thy peaceful balm may give me rest
From ills my heart that tear.
Sweet pitying friend! to whom repair
Poets and mourners for repose,
O, Night! in soft peace end my woes.
Andalusians of Jaén,
proud harvesters of olives,
tell me from your soul, then,
who made the olive groves?
They did not come from nothing,
from money, nor the masters,
only from the silent earth,
and from sweat and toil.
United with pure water,
united with the planets,
the three made the beauty
of the twining trunks.
Rise, white olive tree,
they said at the winds feet.
And the olive raised an arm
weighty as concrete.
who nursed the olive groves?
Your blood, your lives,
not the exploiters
who were enriched by
your sweats generous stream.
Not that of the owner
who buried you in poverty,
who beat at your brows,
who lowered your gaze.
Trees that your zeal
blessed at midday
were the source of bread
that only others ate.
How many ages of olives,
fettered feet and hands,
suns on suns, and moons on moons
weigh on your bones?
whose are these olive groves?
Jaén, rise bravely
from your lunar stone,
youll not be enslaved
nor all your olive groves.
Within the clarity
of oil and its aromas,
they reveal your liberty
the liberty of your loam.
The wild-broom crowned with bay, myrtle, rose,
is the hero among us who faces the debris.
To free each thing without flight, from dust,
below, since it was palm tree and blue, of the sky.
Its swords ardour young and joyfuls unresting.
Thin with fear, purity, sunlight, courage,
the white lily that sweeps across the same grave,
is taller each time, is hotter, is purer.
Never! The wild-broom will never be crucified,
because youth recreates its skeleton,
which is a lone flute, dumb but sonorous.
It is a lone tongue, sublime and harmonious.
And before its quick breath the still dust flies,
and a palm tree, a pillar, climbs towards dawn.
I have sown your womb with love and seed,
prolonged the echo of blood I answered
and I wait in the furrow as the plough waits:
I have reached into the depths.
Dar-haired girl of high towers, lights and eyes,
wife of my skin, deep gulp of my life,
your mad breasts swell towards me, with the leap
of a pregnant doe.
You seem to me like a delicate crystal,
I fear with my lightest touch Ill break you,
and I come with my soldiers skin to reinforce
your veins like a cherry-tree.
Mirror of flesh, support for my wings,
I give life to you in the death they give me but do not take.
Woman, woman, I love you encircled by bullets,
troubled by lead.
Over the fierce coffins in ambush,
over the dead themselves without grave or remedy,
I love you, and long to kiss you with all my heart
until we turn to dust, my wife.
When I reach the battlefield I think of you
my brow not cooling or calming your image,
you approach me like a vast horizon
of hungry teeth.
Write for the battle: feel for me in the trenches:
here with my gun I invoke and fix your name,
and defend your poor womb that awaits me,
and defend your child.
Our child will be born with a clenched fist,
clothed in the clamour of triumph and guitars,
and I will leave my soldiering at the door
toothless and clawless.
One must murder to go on living.
One day Ill enter the far-off shadows of your hair,
and sleep in sheets starched and crackling
sewn by your hand.
Your implacable legs advance towards childbirth,
and your implacable mouth with indomitable lips,
and prior to my solitude of explosions and breaches
you travel a road of implacable kisses.
The peace I am forging shall exist for the child.
And at last in an ocean of irremediable bones
your heart and mine will shipwreck, leaving
a woman and a man, exhausted by kisses.
Painted, not void:
my house is painted
with the vast colour
of tragedy and passion.
It will return from depths
of tears where it was carried
with its empty table,
with is ruined bed.
Kisses will flower
over the pillows.
And wrapped around bodies
the sheet will create
its immense tangle
perfumed, nocturnal.
Hatred will die down
beyond the window.
The talons will be gentle.
Grant me this hope.
The pigeon-house of letters
launches impossible flights
from the rickety tables
where memory leans,
absences weight,
the heart, the silence.
I hear the wing-beat of letters
sailing towards their fate.
Wherever I go I meet
with women and with men
injured by absence,
worn away by time.
Letters, tales, letters:
postcards and dreams,
fragments of tenderness
hurled towards the sky,
sent from blood to blood
from longing to longing.
Although beneath the earth
my loving body may lie,
write to me on earth,
so that I can reply.
In a corner hush
old letters, old scraps.
with the colour of age
coating the writing.
There letters perish
full of trembling.
There ink suffers
and pages fade,
and paper tears,
in a little graveyard
of passions past
of loves to come.
When I write to you
the inkwell stirs,
the cold black well
blushes and trembles,
and a clear human warmth
rises from dark depths.
When I write to you,
my bones begin to write:
I write with indelible ink
of my feelings to you.
There goes my warm letter,
a pigeon forged in flame,
with its folded wings
in the midst its address.
Bird that simply heads for
its nest through air and sky,
your flesh, your hands, your eyes,
and the spaces of your breath.
And you will be naked
beneath your feelings,
unclothed, so as to feel
it all against your breast.
Yesterday a letter remained
abandoned and unclaimed,
hovering over the eyes
of one whose body was lost.
Letters remain alive
speaking for the dead:
Paper, yearning, human,
without eyes to read it.
Though the teeth chatter,
I hear it growing louder
the soft voice of your letter
like an immense clamour.
Ill welcome it in sleep,
if I cant stay awake.
And my wounds will be
flowing wells of ink,
mouths that will tremble
remembering your kisses,
and in their unheard voice
they will murmur: I love you.
Keep hunger in mind: remember its past
trampled weith foremen who pay you in lead.
That wage is paid in blood received,
with a yoke on the soul, and blows to the back.
Hunger paraded its caved-in cows,
its dried-up women, its devoured teats,
its gaping jawbones, its miserable lives
past the strapping bodies of all the eaters.
The abundant years, the satiety, the glut
were only for those who get called boss.
I am here, we are here, to make sure that bread
goes straight to the teeth of the hungry poor.
Maybe we can't be those at the front
who understand life as bloody war-booty:
like sharks, all greed and tooth,
or eager panthers in a world always starving.
Years of hunger have been, for the poor, the only years.
Quantities of bread were heaped up for others,
and hunger wolfed down its ravenous flocks
of crows, clawed things, wolves, scorpions.
I fight, famished, will all my gashes,
scars and wounds, souvenirs and memories
of hunger, against all those smug bellies:
hogs who were born more lowly than hogs.
For having engorged yourselves so basely and brutally,
wallowing deeper than pigs at play,
you will be plunged into this huge current
of blazing spikes, of menacing fists.
You have not wanted to open your cars to hear
the weeping of millions of young workers.
You just pay lip service, when hunger comes to the door
begging with the mouths of the very stars.
In every house: hatred, like a grove of fig trees,
like a quaking bull with shaking horns
breaking loose from the barn, circling, waiting,
and doing you in on its horns as you agonise like dogs.
Friend of my soul, I want to be
the tearful gardener of the earth
you occupy, and enrich, all too soon.
My grief without purpose feeding
the rain, the snail-shells and organs,
Ill give your heart for food
to the desolate poppies.
Such sorrow gathers in my chest,
that I mourn with painful breath.
A harsh slap, an icy blow,
an invisible, murderous axe-stroke,
a brutal thrust has felled you.
Theres no expanse big enough for my hurt,
I weep for my misfortune and yours together
and I feel your death more than I do my life.
I walk on the tracks of the dead,
and without warmth from anyone, or consolation
I go from my feelings to my work.
Too soon death lifted in flight,
too soon the dawn broke,
too soon youre surrounded with earth.
No forgiveness for lovesick death,
no forgiveness for thankless life,
no forgiveness for earth or nothingness.
A storm rises, in my hands,
of rocks, lightning bolts, harsh axes,
thirsty and hungry for catastrophes.
I want to gnaw at the earth with my teeth,
I want to take the earth apart bit by bit
with dry, burning bites.
I want to mine the earth till I find you,
and kiss your noble skull,
and un-shroud you, and return you.
Youll return to my garden, my fig tree:
In the high trellises of flowers,
birdlike your soul, the hive
of angelic waxes and labours.
Youll return to the enamoured farm-hands
ploughshares lullaby.
Youll brighten the shadow of my brow,
and your girl and the bees will go along,
on both sides, arguing over your blood.
My eager voice of a lover
calls from a field of foaming almonds,
to your heart, already ruined velvet.
I summon you to the winged souls
of the creamy almond blossoms,
weve so many things to speak of,
friend, friend of my soul.
(For Federico García Lorca, poet).
Death traverses, with rusty lances,
bearing its cannon, the barren plains
where men cultivate roots and hopes,
raining salt, and scattering skulls.
Green of the gardens,
what skies let happiness thrive?
Sunlight rots the blood, sets it with snares,
and renders the shadows more sombre.
Grief and its cloak
come to meet us once more.
And once more into an alley of tears
rain-soaked I enter.
Ever I see myself within
the shadow of withdrawn bitterness
formed by eyes and staves,
that a candle of agony posts at the entrance
and a furious necklace of hearts.
To weep into a well,
into the one disconsolate source
of water, of sobbing,
of the hearts longing;
where none would see my voice or image,
or would witness the rest of my tears.
I enter slowly, I bow my head
slowly, my heart is torn
slowly, and slowly and blackly
I weep again at the foot of a guitar.
Amidst all the dead of the elegies,
without forgetting the echo of any,
my tear-stained hand chooses one,
who resonates most in my soul.
Federico Garcia
he was once called: dust is his name.
Once he had his place in the sun
today he lies in a hole in the grass.
So much! So much, and now nothing!
Your joyful energy
that energised columns and rows,
you shake and uproot with your teeth,
and now you are sad, and only wish
for the paradise of the grave.
Formed as a skeleton,
dreaming of lead,
armed with indifference and respect
between your eyebrows, you I see, if I gaze.
It has blown away your dovelike life,
that circled the sky and the windows
with foam and cooing
in a torrent of feathers,
that wind, that blows the months away.
Cousin to the apples,
the worm cannot quench your sap,
the maggot cannot consume your death,
and to add fierce health to its fruit
the apple tree will elect your bones.
Though they choke the source of your saliva,
son of the dove,
grandson, of the nightingale and the olive:
you will still be, while the earth turns,
husband of the immortelle
rich soil at the root of the honeysuckle.
How simple death is: how simple,
but how unfairly won!
It cant move slowly, and inflicts
when you least expect it, its turbid wound.
You, the strongest building, ruined,
you, the highest hawk, despoiled,
you, the loudest roar,
hushed, hushed, ever hushed.
May your joyful illustrious blood fall
like a cascade of furious hammers
on those who fatally detained you.
May saliva and sickles
fall on the stains on their brows.
A poet dies and creation feels
the hurt and the dying inside.
A cosmic tremor of icy sweats
shakes the mountains in terror,
and splendour of death the wombs of the rivers.
I hear villages moan and valleys lament,
I see a forest of eyes never dry,
avenues of mourning and veils:
in gusts of wind and leaves,
sorrows on sorrows on sorrows,
tears on tears on tears.
They will not scatter, or blow away, your bones,
volcano of sweetness, thunder of honeycombs,
poet entwined with the bitter and sweet,
who felt the warmth of kisses
between two long files of daggers,
vast love, vast death, vast fire.
To accompany your death,
peopling the corners of sky
and earth, come harmonious flocks,
bolts of blue lightening.
Rattlesnakes hail in abundance,
battalions of gypsies, flutes, tambourines,
showers of bees and violins,
storms of guitars and pianos,
irruptions of trumpets and brass.
But silence exceeds any instrument.
Silent, abandoned, caked with the dust
in the desert of death,
it seems your tongue, it seems your breath,
have shot home the bolt of a door.
As if I walked with your shade,
I walk with mine,
on earth that silence has clothed,
that the cypress would see ever darker.
Your agony grips my throat
like the iron of a gallows,
and I taste a funeral libation.
You know, Federico García Lorca,
I am of those who suffer death each day.
Mouth that tugs at my mouth.
Mouth that has tugged at me:
mouth that comes from far off
to illuminate me with its rays.
Dawn that gives to my nights
a radiance, reddened and white.
Mouth inhabited by mouths:
bird filled with birds.
Song that flaps its wings
upwards and downwards.
Death reduced to kisses,
dying slowly to thirst,
you give the blood-stained grass
two great beats of your wing.
The upper lip is the sky,
and the earth is the lower lip.
Kiss that wheels in the darkness:
kiss that comes rolling
from the first cemetery
to the last stars.
Star that holds your mouth
dumb and enclosed,
until a celestial dew comes
to quiver your eyelids.
Kiss that moves to a future
of young girls and boys,
who wont leave the streets
or the fields empty.
How many mouth-less mouths
already buried we disinter!
I drink from your mouth to them,
toast them from your mouth,
as many as fell: over the wine
in their loving glasses.
They are memories, memories,
kisses distant and bitter.
I sink my life in your mouth,
I hear the murmurs of space,
and infinity seems
to have emptied itself over me.
I have to return to kiss you,
I have to return. I sink: I fall,
descending among the centuries,
towards the deep ravines,
like a feverish snowfall
of kisses and lovers.
Mouth that unearthed
the clearest dawn,
with your tongue. Three words,
youve inherited, three fires:
Life, Death, Love. There they remain
written on your lips.
The onion is frost
enclosed and poor:
frost of your days
and of my nights.
Hunger and onions,
black ice and frost
great and round.
In hungers cradle
my little son lay.
With onion-blood
he was nurtured.
But your bloods
frosted with sugar,
onions and hunger.
A dark-haired woman,
dissolved in moonlight,
spills herself ray by ray
over the cradle.
Laugh, little one,
drink moonlight
if you must.
Lark of my house,
laugh on.
The laughter in your eyes
is the light of the world.
Laugh so that
hearing you, my soul
will fly through space.
Your laughter frees me,
grants me wings.
Solitude it banishes,
pulls down my prison.
Mouth that soars,
heart that is lightning
on your lips.
Your laugh is a sword,
ever victorious.
Conqueror of flowers
and larks.
Rival of sunlight,
future of my bones
and my love.
The flesh flutters,
sudden as an eyelid,
a child as never before
painted.
How many goldfinches
soar and flutter
from your body!
I woke from childhood.
Never wake.
My mouth is sad.
Laugh forever.
Ever in your cradle,
defending laughter
feather by feather.
Youre a flight so high,
so extensive,
that your flesh is the sky
newborn.
If only I could
climb to the source
of your flight!
For eight months you laugh
with five orange blossoms.
With five tiny
ferocities.
With five teeth
like five adolescent
jasmine buds.
Theyll be the frontier
of kisses tomorrow,
when you feel a weapon
between your teeth.
Feel a flame
run past your teeth
seeking the core.
Fly child on the double
moon of her breast.
It, saddened by onions.
You, satisfied.
Never give way.
Ignore what passes
ignore what happens.
It did not recognise the meeting
of the he and she.
The blossom so enamoured
could not become flowery.
It stopped its senses,
refused discovery,
descended diaphanous
before lights clarity.
It saw tomorrows cloudiness,
stayed, in yesterdays history.
It did not want to be.
For un-feathering the glacial archangels,
the barbed-lily snowfall of slender teeth
is condemned to the weeping of fountains
and the sadness of well-springs.
For diffusing its soul into metal,
for the fire to grant its sunrise to iron,
the torrential blacksmiths draw it
to the sorrow of harsh anvils.
To the painful sting of the thorn,
to the fatal discouragement of the rose,
and the corrosive action of dying,
I see myself given, and all this ruin
is for no other misfortune, no other reason
than loving you, and only loving you.
They never departed
the garden of embraces.
And round the red rose
of kisses they travelled.
Hurricanes wanted
to part them with rancour.
And sharp axes,
and bony lightning.
They added to a land
of pallid hands.
They measured cliffs
impelled by the wind
between molten mouths.
They delved through shipwrecks
their arms each time
deeper in their bodies.
Persecuted, drowned,
by a great helplessness
of memories and moons,
of November and March,
they saw themselves blown
like inconstant dust:
they saw themselves blown,
but always embracing.
The winds of the people carry me,
the winds of the people blow me on,
scattering this heart of mine
and readying my throat.
Oxen bow their heads,
impotently weak,
at their punishment:
lions lift theirs
and at the same time punish
with their clamorous claws.
I am not from a race of oxen,
I am from a race that holds
the mines of lions,
the passes of eagles,
and the ridges of bulls
with pride in the horn.
Oxen never prospered
in the wastes of Spain.
Who spoke of throwing a yoke
over the neck of this race?
Who ever yoked
or hobbled a hurricane?
or kept a lightning bolt
a prisoner in a jail?
Asturians of courage,
Basques of armoured stone,
Valencians of happiness
and Castilians of soul,
labouring like the earth
graceful as wings;
Amdalusians of lightning
born among the guitars
and forged on torrential
anvils of tears;
Estramadurans of rye,
Galicians of rain and calm,
Catalans of firmness
Aragonese of lime,
Murcians of dynamite
fruitfully multiplied,
Leonese, Navarrese, masters
of hunger, sweat and the axe,
kings of minerals,
lords of the tilled soil,
men who among the roots,
like elegant roots,
go from life to death,
go from void to void:
people of ill descent
want to put yokes on you,
yoke you must leave
broken across their backs.
The twilight of the oxen
is the point of daybreak.
Oxen die humble,
clothed in the stink of stables;
the eagles, the lions,
the bulls, die with pride,
and behind them the sky
is un-darkened and endless.
The agony of the oxen
makes the spirit small,
that of the wild creature
enhances all creation.
If I am dying, let me die
with my head held high.
Dead and twenty times dead,
my mouth in the grass,
Ill keep my teeth clenched
and my chin resolute.
Singing I wait for death,
for there are nightingales that sing
above the fusillades
and in the midst of battle.
Only he who loves, flies. But who loves enough
to be like the slightest and most fugitive bird?
It goes eastwards sinking, commanding hatred, all that
might have wanted to rise again, direct and alive.
To love... But who loves? To fly... But who flies?
I will conquer the blue, eager for plumage,
but love, always beneath, is saddened
at not finding the wings that sure courage gives.
An ardent being, clear of desires, winged,
wanted to ascend, to have freedom in which to nest.
He wanted to forget that men move away in chains.
Where they lacked feathers put valour and oblivion.
Sometimes he flew so high, that the sky shone
over his skin, under his skin, the bird.
Being, you who were once confused with a lark,
others, like weights of hail, brought you down.
You know already the lives of the rest are flagstones
to cover you: prisons to swallow whats yours.
It passes, life, among bodies, behind bars of beauty.
Through the bars, the blood flows free.
Sad instrument happy to be worn: urgent
tube for desiring and breathing fire.
Sword devoured by constant use.
Body in whose closed horizon I unfold.
You will not fly. You cannot fly, body that wanders
through these corridors where the air is my knot.
No matter how hard you struggle in ascending, you are wrecked.
You will not cry out. The field is what follows, deserted and mute.
The arms do not flutter. Perhaps they are tail-feathers
that the heart wanted to launch into the firmament.
The blood is saddened at fighting on alone.
The eyes turn saddened from knowledge of evil.
Each city, sleeping, waking crazy, exhales
the silence of prison, of sleep that burns and rains down,
like a hoarse insect having no power to take wing.
The man lies down. The sky lifts itself. The air moves.
At the outpouring of your voice, its gentleness
of honeyed mouth, and its pure swaying,
desire lays its roses in my earthly
hands, beside the customary fire.
Exasperated, I reach the summit
of your island breast, and surround it
with an ambitious sea, and the stamp
of exasperated petals of light.
But you defend yourself, with walls,
from the eagerness of my moods,
that drown you in oceans and lands.
For pure stone, indifferent, you keep silence:
to keep the silence of stone you pile, and pile,
more and more roses into my hands.
Each time I pass
beneath your window,
the perfume strikes me
that still floats through your house.
pass by the graveyard
the power arrests me
that still breathes through your bones.
Like a young fig tree
you were, on the cliffs.
And when I passed by
you rang in the mountains.
Like the young fig tree,
brilliant and blind.
Like a fig tree you are.
Like an ancient fig.
And I pass, and you greet me
with dry leaves and silence.
Like a fig tree you are
that the lightning has aged.
Love ascended between us
like the moon between two palm-trees
that have never embraced.
The intimate murmur of our two bodies
made the cooing the sea-swell brings,
but the hoarse voice was stifled,
the lips turned to stone.
The yearning to encircle moved our flesh
illuminated our inflamed bones,
but our arms desire to reach out
died away in our arms.
Love and the moon passed between us
and devoured our lonely bodies.
And we are two ghosts who search
and find each other from afar.
The cemetery is near
where you and I are sleeping,
between blue prickly-pears,
blue agaves and children,
who scream excitedly
if the dead darken the road.
From here to the cemetery, all
is blue, golden, clear.
Four paces, and the dead.
Four paces, and the living.
Clear, blue and golden,
my son there grows remote.
The sun, the rose, and the child
were born the flowers of the day.
Things of every day
suns, flowers, new children.
Tomorrow Ill be no more:
someone else will be real.
Ill be no more, beyond
those who wish for their memory.
The flower of a day is tallest
at the foot of the smallest thing.
Flower of light, the lightning flash,
and flower of the moment, time.
Between the flowers you went.
Between the flowers I remain.
It would have been less painful if it had been
nard your complexion to my gaze, nard,
thistle your skin to my touch, thistle,
bitter-apple your voice to my ears, bitter.
Bitter-apple is your voice to my ears, bitter,
and I burn, in and around your voice, I burn,
and Im slow to burn, what Im slow to offer,
juniper oil, my voice for yours, juniper.
Briar is your hand, if I hold it, briar,
wave your body, if I reach for it, wave,
close to me once, yet a thousand times not close.
Heron is my pain, a slender sad heron,
alone like a breath and a cry, alone,
stubborn in its error and disgrace, stubborn.
Grasses, nettles,
advance into autumn
with silkiness
and a slow tenderness.
Autumn, a flavour
that separates things,
that pulls them apart.
It rains on a roof
as if on a coffin
while the grass-blade grows
like a young wing.
The same sap nurtures
the grasses, the nettles.
Carry me to the graveyard
of worn-out shoes.
At all hours throw me
a pen of wild-broom.
Sow me with statues
rigidly gazing.
Through an orchard of mouths,
promising, golden
my shade will glow.
My name is earth, though Im named Miguel.
Earth is my craft and my destiny
and stains what it licks with its tongue.
Im a sad component of pathways.
Im a sweetly infamous tongue,
worshipping feet that I love.
Like a nocturnal ox of floods and fallows
that yearns to be a creature worshipped,
I fawn on your shoes, and all around them,
and, made for covering, and made for kisses,
I kiss your heel that wounds me, strew it with flowers.
I set a remembrance of my being
on your biting heel, under your tread,
and at your step I advance
lest your indifferent foot despise
all the love Ive raised towards it.
Moister than my face with its tears,
when the glass bleats frozen wool,
when winter closes your window
I fall at your feet, the tip of a wing,
a soiled wing, and heart of earth.
I fall at your feet a molten branch
of lowly honey, trampled, alone,
a heart despised and a heart fallen,
formed like seaweed, oceans aspect.
Earth, in vain, Im clothed with poppies,
earth, in vain, emptied I see my arms,
earth, in vain I bite at your heels,
dealing maleficent wing-blows
foul words like convulsed hearts.
You hurt me in treading, printing
the track of your going upon me,
it tears, it ruptures the armour,
of honeyed duality circling my mouth
in the pure and living flesh,
ever begging to be crushed to pieces
by your free and madcap hares foot.
Its taciturn cream curdles,
a sobbing shakes its tree
of cerebral wool at your tread.
And you pass, and it remains
burning its winter wax before the sunset,
martyr, jewel and grass to the wheel.
Weary of yielding to the whirling
daggers of wagons and hooves,
fear, from the earth, a spawn of creatures
with corrosive skin and vengeful claws.
Fear the earth reborn in an instant,
fear lest it rise and grow and cover,
tenderly and jealously
your reed-like ankle, my torment,
fear lest it drowns the nard of your legs
and rising ascends to your brow.
Fear lest it raises a hurricane
from the bland territory of winter
and bursts in thunder and falls in rain
into your blood harsh and tender.
Fear an assault of offended foam
and fear an amorous cataclysm.
Before the drought consumes it
earth must turn to earth again.
You threw me a lemon, so bitter,
with a hand warm and so pure,
that its shape was not spoiled,
and I tasted its bitterness regardless.
With that yellow blow, from a sweet lethargy,
my blood passed to an anxious fever,
feeling the bite of the tip
of a breast that was firm and full.
But on gazing at you and seeing the smile
that broke from you, at this acid act,
so different from my voracious malice,
my blood stood still, inside my shirt,
and became that porous and golden breast
a pointed and dazzling pain.
Because of your feet, where your beauty ends
in ten fragments of whiteness, more a dance,
a dove ascends to your waist,
an unending balm falls to earth.
Along with your feet goes the wonder
of nacre, in a ridiculous narrowness,
and where your feet go whiteness goes,
a dog sowing anklets of jasmine.
At your feet, as much foam as shore,
sand and sea reach me, and ebb from me,
and I try to enter the sheepfold of your sole.
I enter and let myself pass to your soul itself,
with the loving voice of the grapes:
trample my heart, now its ripe.
What does the wind of bitterness want
that it comes down the gully
and forces the windows
while I dress you in my arms?
To overthrow us, pull us down.
Overthrown, pulled down,
both our bloods receding.
What more does the wind want
more bitterly each moment?
To part us.
Do you recall that throat, call up a memory
of former privilege, of that former matter
that was, almond-like, white and lovely,
an almond-flower of half-rotating cream?
I recall and do not recall that history
of ivory dying away into hair,
where the swanss neck learnt how to frown
and proclaim ephemeral snow.
I recall and do not recall that core
of choke-able feminine coldness,
like a brief and milky track.
And I recall that kiss without rest,
that stayed between my mouth and the path
of that neck, the kiss and the day.
Silence of metal sad and sonorous,
swords clustering with love
in the depths of the ruinous bone
of the bulls volcanic regions.
The moistness of feminine gold
smelt, set splendour in his blood:
his roar took refuge among flowers
like a vast hurricane of lament.
He is drowning the tender clover
of coupling and fiery goring
with the grief of a thousand lovers.
Beneath his skin concealed furies
in the cradle of his horns,
are spinning thoughts of death.
To smile with the sad joy of the olive-tree.
To wait. Never to tire of hoping for joy.
We smile. We gild the light of every day
with this sad joyful vanity of being alive.
Every day I feel freer and more a captive
of that full smile so clear and so shadowed.
Tempests blow over your frozen mouth
while over mine still blows a summer breeze.
A smile rises up over the abyss: grows
like a tremulous abyss, bravely winged.
A smile lifts warmly upwards in flight.
Diurnal, firm, it arrives, no fall, no darkening.
You defy all things, love: you scale them all.
In a smile you were both earth and heaven.
You are dying of purity and simplicity:
I am guilty, love, Im confessing
that I, intrepid snatcher of kisses,
I sipped at the flower of your cheek.
I sipped at the flower of your cheek,
and since that glory, that event,
your cheek, so careful and serious,
droops, despoiled and sallow.
The ghost of that delinquent kiss
haunts your persecuted cheekbone,
always more obvious, dark and immense.
And you are sleepless, zealously
watching my mouth, with such care,
so nothing corrupts or outrages!
Wretched wars
when love is not our aim.
Wretched, wretched.
Wretched weapons
those that are not words.
Wretched men
that die not out of love.
Your heart, a frozen orange, a centre,
within, without light, of sweet juniper oil
and a porous appearance of gold: a surface
that promises danger to those who look.
My heart, a feverish pomegranate
of clustered blushes, and opened wax,
which might offer you its tender seeds
with an enamoured obstinacy.
Ay! What an experience of loss
to go to your heart and find a coldness
of irreducible and fearful snow!
Through the outskirts of my weeping
a thirsty handkerchief goes flying,
with the hope of one who might drink there.
I have a need for your voice,
a longing for your company,
and an ache of melancholy
for the absence of signs of arrival.
Patience requires my torment,
the urgent need for you, heron of love,
your solar mercy for my frozen day,
your help, for my wound, I count on.
Ah, need, ache and longing!
Your kisses of substance, my food,
fail me, and Im dying with the May.
I want you to come, the flower of your absence,
to calm the brow of thought
that ruins me with its eternal lightning.
"Where, cruel one, where go you, where?; hold back,
hold back your swiftly fleeting steps, so long
as of my hearfelt pain the long lament
to open this my deepest vein begins;
hear the voice filled with a thousand sighs
and with the sad song of my suffering;
you can't be cruel and harsh to such extent
that my grief doesn't move you to chagrin;
turn your light upon me, turn your eyes,
before darkness engulfs me in its mist,"
I said in sleep, or in illusions lost.
I woke up, found myself alone, 'midst thorns,
and not by light but by black clouds hemmed in,
and in a flood of burning tears transformed.
I dared and feared: but daring was so strong
that I then came to scorn cowardly fear;
I climbed to where fire most ignites and burns me
as I despaired most of hope to possess.
In error have I wasted all my youth;
now I can see the harm, but it's too late,
for common sense no longer can protect
him who surrenders, blind, to stubbornness.
At times I try (but to what end?) to rise
above the weight that presses on my neck;
although my failing strength can't pass the test.
My madness I pursue, then, for to change
now does no good, nor should one rate so low
him who so fully yielded up his breast.
I climb collapsing under such great weight
this lofty, steep, and craggy mountainside,
that I scarce reach the summit when I step
on air, and, tumbling, to the base I slide.
All battered by the blows and by the load,
I barely rise, and to my old travails
I must return; but to what end? The ground
itself on my accustomed journey fails.
But, though the danger causes me to swoon,
I don't give up my quest; rather, again
my wearying exertions I repeat.
Fear grows, and in persistence so do I;
and without pause, as wheels must ever turn,
so I once more plunge down to my defeat.
He is the Cura—Long the silent peaks
Have watched him breast his hardships on his knees,—
Risking the passes when the winters freeze,—
Taking the lonely routes the midnight seeks.—
As though by magic, 'neath his blessing hand
A plenteous harvest its responses speaks;
His very mule indulgenced graces leaks
That lift the parish to a heavenly land.
From his asperges to his clogs and hook
He turns in readiness to drain his brook
Of mountain gold to deck his altar rude;
His preaching through a breath of basil sounds,—
A nephew is his only turpitude—
His piety with cowlike airs abounds.
In blessed silence vegetates the place;
The wax-faced Virgins sleep in their attire
Of livid velvets and discolored wire,
And Gabriel's trumpet wearies on his face.
A marble yawn the dried-up font would trace;
There sneezes an old woman in the choir;
And in the sun-shaft dust the flies aspire,
As though 'twere Jacob's ladder for their grace.
The good old soul is starting at her chores;
She shakes the poor-box, and in reverence pores
To find how the Saint Vincent alms are going;
Then here and there her feather-duster hies;
While through the vestry doorway, come the cries
From out the barnyard and the gallant crowing.
Evening rewards hard toil with heavenly gold...
Women appear in dainty cotton dresses,
plait sprigs of lime and lily in their tresses,
or ply the needle on the cool threshold.
Two girls with water-pitchers sidle by...
The shawls, the studded boots, the walking-sticks;
the sleepy lapse of time that quietly ticks.
Combing the thickets, an Arcadian sigh...
Strict silence falls... Marimbas start to twang
their ballads at the pond where vapours hang.
The lakes fade out as ghostly pinpoints burn,
the hills, now mythic, wear a rosy crown...
Far off, the tracks are smoking, dusty-brown,
as all who labour in the fields return.
Long ere the noisy barnyard sounds, or ere
The dusky smithy strikes its morning lay,—
Ere chemist wakes, or barber starts his day,
A single lamp burns, — lightless on the square.
Athwart the melancholy dawning fare
The oxen, throwing up their furrow way;
Beneath the gloom of the unsettled gray
The ploughman mutters rustic curses there.
Meantime the lordly manor dreams. — The jet
Through its old marble speaks the fountain's soul;
And where the tranquil shepherd's-star is set,
Waking the lone path's yearning for its goal
Of old, slow breathing airs in echo roll
From tinkling carts the daybreaks ne'er forget.
Mañanicas floridas
del frío invierno
recordad a mi niño
que duerme al hilo.
Lope de Vega
The night dressed up, flake after flake,
feather upon feather,
that which was but flame and gold,
cote of mail of a martial autumn 
now whiteness realm.
What am I doing, I wonder, defiling,
trampling such exquisite plumage underfoot?
And I tear apart with my hands
a fistful of snow, as though a young pigeon,
and caress, gently rock and protect it
with utter love, care and tenderness.
So that it wont cry with cold.
The hand is the one that remembers
The travels through the years, 
And it disembogues into the present
Always remembering.
It scribbles down, all shaken,
That which lay forgotten.
Memorys hand,
Always at the rescue.
The ghostly images
Will then harden, and
Start telling who they were,
And why they are back.
Why they were but dreams fodder,
Sheer nostalgic matter.
And the hand rescues this all
From its magical limbo.
The olive trees
in the morning
cast a white shadow.
A gauze
of frost
covers the land.
With drops of water
the farm
is covered.
This crumpling into the arms of an unknown girl,
this brute job of trampling on butterflies, shadows, corpses;
this thinking of yourself as a tree, a bottle, or a flow of alcohol,
a print of a sleeping foot, a black or green jackknife;
this hard instant when a girl screams
and, shuddering, dreams of the goodness that was never hers.
All of this is not only the night,
but the night pregnant with blood and milk,
with asphyxiating children,
with women burned down to carbon
and men darkened by loneliness
and mysterious, suffocating waste.
Only the night of the drunken girl
whose sad, raging calls
wounded me like pure tears,
like nauseas and grudges,
like neglect and the begging of girls.
How sad these tears, friends, made of powdered glass
and funereal gardenias, shredded in the doorways of bars,
ground tears and swear, in which naked men, with only black beards
and hands as ugly as honey wash themselves without anguish, without sadness;
drunken crying, tears like carnations, like mildewed taverns,
tears like that girls, neither bored nor grieving, who gets drunk,
like the girls who one night, one holy night,
gave me her melting heart,
her hands of warm water, budding earth, silk,
her thoughts so like dead birds
her wooden seizures of tenderness,
her mouth tasting like a cup gnawed by drunks,
her breast soft as a fevered cheek,
her tattooed arms and legs,
her incipient tuberculosis,
and her cunt sleeping like a martyred orchid.
Ah, the drunken girl, the girl of the dumb smile
and generosity at her fingertips,
the girl of the trusting, unspeakable sweetness for a man,
a man like me, barely escaped from the violence of loving.
This tender memory will always be a lamp before my eyes,
a bloody and defeated day.
My friends, heres to the drunken girl.
Let verse be as a key
that opens a thousand doors.
A leaf falls; something passes flying;
let all that the eyes see become created,
and let the soul of the hearer stand trembling.
Discover new worlds and keep watch over your word;
when an adjective does not strengthen, it destroys.
We are in the cycle of nerves.
Our brawn hangs
like a memory, in museums;
but not for that are we less strong:
the true vigour
abides in the head.
Poets: why do you sing of the rose?
Make it bloom in your poem!
For us alone
live all things under the sun.
The poet is a little God.
My son, don't be a fool, keep your freedom;
Since you love well, don't tie the knot.
Have, if you can, six hundred faces,
Seek loves, not love, that's too much fuss.
To this lady and to that, give satisfaction
But don't give in, that's just for foolish boys.
If someone tells you that you do wrong,
Cover your ears and let hundreds talk.
Believe me, there is no greater pleasure
Than to draw blood and defame to the extreme;
Even if the trick costs much, it's worth it.
Roam the high seas under sail and oar,
Keep your feet dry and fish all you may,
Without having to say I'm afraid or not.
Be for your father a Polyphemus,
Calling dark Mandinga, Galatea,
Beautiful Phoenix, the most ugly.
Ply your skills on a hundred for me,
Lend them your jewels for a while.
They are all the same below the waist.
Give not two straws for any,
Attack, for there is no Virginia alive,
To offend this world with her disdain.
And the one who acts a diva,
In her haughtiness follow her plan,
The game is fiercer than any mastiff.
Busy yourself with a hundred,
But have only one in your thoughts.
Attend to one there and then go elsewhere,
For the world is made like this:
One person is the scourge of those who suffer,
They are only a hair away from the beasts.
And because I fear
You will squander your fortune,
Spend it with caution, I say;
Set a plate for all
With a million million promises,
And enter with a single and two dams.
He who from so many brothels has escaped
And frequented so much whoredom,
Finally into Cupid's hands
Brings at last his sin!
I would rather have a bubo on either side
And spittle on the opposite end,
Than see me old and mad, a guest
Of the wind, in love with air.
I early began to take this path,
Not free from struggle for an hour,
And the total reckoning I pay now.
Wretched boy, restrain your hand,
Or I shall whip you with your blindfold,
And pluck your wings feather by feather.
Madam, you with the bow and arrows,
Who are always out hunting in the wild,
Tell me, on your life, has no man ever
Brushed his hands across your teats?
Roaming the hiddenmost forests,
Pursuing a deer or a stag,
Has there been no impudent shepherd
To teach you the bare-legged cross step?
You may make a fuss and turn up your nose,
Saying that no one, with such a famous,
Such a chaste goddess, would so dare.
Over there for your nymphs that may be enough,
But here, for common folk, by God it's nothing,
For anyone can go a bit too far.
A certain lady prided herself on her chatter,
And even more on being a great nicknamer,
And meeting a young fellow unexpectedly,
Not knowing him or even who he was,
She told him, seeing his fine figure and air:
"You resemble Saint Peter," and then
broke into a most hearty laugh,
As if that nickname were truly his.
The young man glanced back and found her not ugly,
And seeing a dame well versed in certain arts,
He answered her with these gallant words:
"My Lady, although St. Peter I may not be,
At least I have here the key,
That will unlock your paradise."
Inside a sacred temple an honest man
With great devotion was praying one day,
His eyes wellsprings as he dispatched
A thousand sighs from his passionate breast.
After kissing for a great while
The holy beads which tightly he grasped,
With them the good man tapped
His eyes, mouth, temples, and side.
His devotion grew and grew until finally,
He attempted to kiss the ground,
Believing the greatest humility is in this.
He asked room of an old lady and she
Turned her back to show him her behind,
Saying, "Kiss here, Sir, for 'tis all earth."
But whither are you wandering, if its already the past?
The heirlooms absolute word,
The country of foams terracotta
The rube and the ha, the gullibles fair,
soon youll be, even if you dont desire such change,
youd prefer to live with a shaking,
at thiefs first glance,
either neverÂ come or come to us too late.
—pâles fantômes fuyants,
La nuit reluit sur ton front hâlé, altier et fragile
Tes mains, deux lunes pâles sur mon front.

&mdash;Where the shore?&mdash;

Im a broken bell,
lily without scent,
fountain that has lost
its lively murmur.
My rosebushes grow
only long thorns.
Im black wheat
that makes bitter bread.
Why would you want me
if I dont have scent or savor?
if my apples are withered?
The golden pollen
that gave me life
has been diluted
with dark dust.
Go on, let Death know
that Im expecting her.
that Im made of bronze.
That my eyes
dont know how to cry,
and that my lips
cant kiss.
Go on. King Midas
passed by here,
and I was transformed
into a statue of gold.
Go! Dont whisper
that word again,
that abracadabra
to break my enchantment.
Dont say a word,
dont hang around here.
If the statue comes to life,
youll be sorry.
Take me now though its early
I bring fresh dahlias in my hands.
Take me now though its somber
and silent is my head.
Now that my body smells sweet
and the eyes are clean and like a rose is my skin.
Now that I have on my soles
the living sandals of the spring.
Now on my lips the laughter rings
like a bell rings in a hurry.
Later...Ah! I know
nothing much of it will remain later!
Useless will be then your desire
like an offering placed in a mausoleum.
Take me now though its early,
my hands with nard are richly creamed.
Today, but not much late. Before the night falls,
and the fresh corolla withers off.
Today, and not tomorrow. Oh Lover! Dont you see
that a creeper grows into a cypress?
All the gold in the world lacked
Luster in the evening shine!
Barely in the twilight of rose
Were the tops of trees dyed.
A surprise love, my hand joined
With his hand, dark and trembling!
We were Booz and Ruth before the beauty
That surrounded the farmstead.
Will you love me? You whispered. Slowly and surely,
Trilled in my lips the soft promise
Of sweetness to lover from Moabita.
And it was like an Amen! In that moment
The rhythm of oration rose vibrating
With the rhythm of the hermitage bell.
The most superior beauty
if it lacks discretion,
Don't you know what it looks like?
showy flower without pain.
Those who are groomed and puled,
and who boast in their dress,
or they want to be liked,
or they like themselves a lot.
Love beats all,
Time consume everything:
Which of both can do more,
that child, or this old man?
The beautiful light of the fire
the butterfly misleads:
the sun itself encourages it,
the image of the sun kills her.
A farm there was, with a poultry-yard,
Where roved an old bantam about;
And laid at his ease, a pig was barrd
In a sty close by without.
A lamb moreover was raised up there;
We know it does so befall:
Together in farms these animals fare,
And in good company all.
Well, with your leave, said the pig one day
To the lamb, what a happy life!
And healthful too, to be sleeping away,
Ones time without cares or strife!
I say there is nothing, as I am a pig,
Like sleeping, stretchd out at ease;
Let the world go round with its whirligig,
And cares just as it may please.
The other the contrary chanced to tell
The same little lamb, to take heed;
Look, innocent! here, to live right well,
Sleep very little indeed.
Summer or winter, early to rise
With the stars the practice seek;
For sleeping the senses stupefies,
And leaves you languid and weak.
Confused, the poor lamb the counsels compares,
And cannot perceive in his mind,
That contrary each advising declares,
But how he himself is inclined.
And thus we find authors the practice make,
To hold, as infallibly true,
The rules they fancy themselves to take,
And in their own writings pursue.
Life:
seal my pact with you.
Sink your blue arms
through the arc of my mouth,
spill like a river
through the brackish galleries of my body, arrive
like a thief, like that one
upon whose brow they suddenly print
the burning impact of good fortune,
like one who can no longer hide magnificent news
beneath the overcoat and wants to laugh alone,
and there is the love that sloshes head to toe
and tinges everything,
and there is not a soul who sees it and doesnt want
to kiss her palms two times.
Life: loom within my flesh, in the marine
labyrinth of my core,
and care with irrepressible rapture
for this infinitesimal child
plotted by the crossing of fire of two sexes.
For him I must break my heart in two
to cover his diminutive soles.
Life: place over his head at the height of a bird
the roof of your hand. Never abandon
this cub of man who looks at you
from the silvery dream of his pot of moon.
Place, with wild lightness, your inaugural kiss
on those ribs of a toy walnut ship. Dont abandon him,
he is your earthly animal, the fistful of feathers
where the wind splits.
Life: welcome this being
who fits within a peach.
In his name I name you his godmother.
I raise up my womb for you.
Life: open your arms.
Loki sings in the desolate dark region,
and there are mists of blood in Loki's song.
The Shepherd pastures his mighty flock of ice
which obeys - giants that tremble - the voice of the Shepherd.
Loki sings to the icy winds that pass,
and there are mists of boold in Loki's song. 
Thick fog is hovering. Waves break
on the steep rocks with a deafening roar.
On their dark back rocks the wild boat of the red-
haired warrior, sullen and fierce.
Loki sings to the roaring waves that pass,
When the hymn of iron soars into space,
its echo answered by evil clamour,
and in the deep hallowed pit the victim seeks,
with stiff outstretched arms, the shadow of the God,
Loki sings to the chalk-white corpse that passes,
Little eyes of sorrow,
moon little face,
the girl cried
without any cause.
The mother sang
rocking the cradle:
ÂDon't cry without sorrow,
moon little faceÂ.
the girl was crying
love without luck.
ÂWhat a crying of girl 
without any cause!Â,
thought the mother,
as in front of her cradle:
ÂWhat do you know about pain
moon little face!Â
the girl is already a mother
that she loved without luck;
and she comforts her son
rocking her cradle:
ÂDon't cry, my son,
without any cause;
Can't you see it hurts?
moon little face?Â
Little eyes of sorrow
the girl is already a grandma
that she was crying in her cradle.
While dying she weeps
her death importunates her.
ÂWhy are you crying, grandma,
without any cause?Â
Crying your sorrow
Who saw the others?
But they are all pains
moon little face.
Lovely Enarda! young and old
All quarrel with me daily:
Because I write to thee they scold,
Perhaps sweet verses gaily.
A judge should be more grave, they say,
As each my song accuses;
From such pursuits should turn away
As trifling with the Muses.
How wofully you waste your time!
Preach others; but, all slighting,
The more they scold, the more I rhyme;
Still I must keep on writing.
Enardas heart and mind to praise,
All others far excelling,
My rustic pipe its note shall raise,
In well-toned measures telling.
I wish, extolling to the skies,
Her beautys high perfection
To sing, and all her witcheries
Of feature and complexion:
With master pencil to portray
Her snowy neck and forehead,
And eyes that round so roguish play,
And lips like carmine florid.
And let the Catos go at will,
To where they most prefer it,
Who withering frowns and sneerings still
Give me for my demerit.
In spite of all, with wrinkled pate,
The censures each rehearses,
Enarda I will celebrate
For ever in my verses.

The answers have all been used up.
Perhaps they never existed
and were only mirrors
face to face with emptiness.
But now the questions have also been used up.
The mirrors have broken,
even those that reflected nothing.
And theres no way to fix them.
perhaps a question remains somewhere.
Silence is also a question.
A mirror remains that cant be broken
because it faces nothing,
because its inside everything.
Weve found a question.
Can silence also be an answer?
Perhaps a certain heights
questions and answers are exactly the same.
That haughty tyranny of thine,
That neck unbending, Love shall take,
I vow, and victim of thee make
In harsh subjection to repine.
Live out thy vain and care-free days,
Love's bitter ways
Shall charge the measure of my score,
When of thy sorrow none shall more
Take any notice whoso pays.
When through the golden locks that crown
Thy brows the scattered snows shall run,
And thy twin daystars have begun
To dim their lights of old renown;
When the first wrinkle line shall sear
Thy visage clear,
And beauty's time is done and over,
And he is fugitive the lover
That found the rose so fresh and dear;
When thou shalt see thy cause is lost,
And findst thy loving is but weeping,
Thou then shalt know the woe unsleeping
In love that with no love is crossed;
Lady, then with grief shalt say,
That hapless day:
Would I had now, alas, my fate!
That beauty that was mine of late,
Or that old love I cast away!
The thousands whom your coldness spurned
And left to sorrows, on that day
Of vengeance shall be glad and gay
When they have thy discomfort learned;
And Love himself shall take the wing
And publishing
The novel tale of thy disgrace,
To all who mock shall show thy face
To warn them 'gainst the loveless thing.
Alas, by heaven, my lady fair,
Behold thyself in flower so pure
And gracious that cannot endure,
But left unplucked is lost fore'er;
And since no less discreet thou art
In equal part
Than fair and scornful to the view,
Look thou how everything is due
And subject to the loving heart!
'Tis Love that governs all the skies
With law eternal and most sweet;
Thinkst thyself strong enough to meet
Such foe in this poor world of lies?
'Tis Love gives movement and delight
And beauty's might,
It is the very sweet of life;
So that the fate with it at strife
Is saddened with a pauper's blight.
Of what avail the golden cup,
The silken vesture and brocade,
The ceiling with its gems inlaid,
The piles of treasures mounting up?
Of what avail the fertile breast
Of all earth's best,
And its adoring -- if in fine,
O lady, slumbering be thine
Alone where the cold couch is dressed?
In dalliance Roderic the King
Delayed with fair La Cava by the side
Of Tagus' gorge, till clamoring
The river-god from out the tide
Emerged, and in a voice prophetic cried:
Licentious despot, would you choose
Such hour for weakness! Now when thunders sound
And trumpetings of death confuse!
When clash and shout of Mars astound
Our land, and conflagrations spread around!
Alas, for thy mere pleasure, how
Our country groans! That lovely one (O day
Unhallowed of her birth!) doth now
On Spain bring weeping and dismay,
To sweep the sceptre of the Goths away!
Flames, supplications, shouts of war,
Laments of death and anguish and disgrace,
That brief embrace is twining for!
Involving you and all the race
In shame the ages never shall efface!
A yoke of slavery on the lands,
They till at Constantina, where the stream
Of Ebro, where Sansueña's strands
And Lusitania's reach extreme
On all the spacious Spains, a doom supreme!
Hark, out of Cadiz raging calls
Count Julian's voice to speak a father's wrongs!
No shame of treachery appals
He conjures up avenging throngs
To waste the kingdom that to you belongs!
Adown the morn the trumpet's throat
Proclaims the doom! See, on Morocco's shore
What thronging, when his banners float
Upon the winds conspired to pour
So swift on Spain the Moslem conqueror!
The cruel Arab lifts his lance
And shakes his gleaming challenge to the wind;
Swiftly his light flotillas dance
Upon their way of warfare blind
See all their numbers swarming on my mind!
The trembling earth is hidden where they tread;
Their sails blot out the intervening sea;
Their clamors strike the heaven with dread;
The sun from out the noon would flee
Before the dust cloud and obscurity!
Alas, how ardently their prows
Surmount the waves! What sinews bend the oar
As every galley onward plows
And how the deeps must foam and roar,
When they glide hissing on the Spanish shore!
To Eolus their sails are given
And over Hercules's unguarded straits
Their sharpened prows of steel are driven
Where Neptune, the great father, waits
To grant them ingress by his open gates.
Alas! poor wretch, that bosom dear
Can still bewitch you? that you draw no sword,
When such calamities you hear?
When even upon the sacred ford
Tarifa falls already to the horde!
Out in the saddle! Spread your wing
Across the mountains! Spare not on the plain
Your bloody spurs! There brandishing
The goad, come thundering amain
Upon them, Roderic, with blade insane!
But oh! what travail now prepares,
What years of sweat and carnage are ordained
On him who shield and breastplate bears,
On princeling who might else have reigned,
On horse and rider to destruction chained!
Thou Stream of Betis, - shalt be dyed
With mingling blood of kinsmen and of foes!
Unto the sea how soon thy tide
With broken wrack of helmets flows,
And surge of corpses kingly in their woes!
Five days of blood infuriate
The God of war unloosens on the plains,
Where meet the swarming hordes of hate;
The sixth, alas, thy doom ordains!
O land beloved, in barbaric chains!
To Don Loarte
When I contemplate o'er me
The heaven of stars profound,
And mark the earth before me
In darkness swathed around,—
In careless slumber and oblivion bound;
Then love and longing waken
The anguish of my soul;
Mine eyes with tears are taken
Like founts beyond control,
My voice sighs forth at last its voice of dole:—
O Temple-Seat of Glory,
Of Beauteousness and Light,
To thy calm promontory
My soul was born! What blight
Holds it endungeoned here from such a height?
What mortal aberration
Hath so estranged mankind
That from God's destination
He turns, abandoned, blind,
To follow mocking shade and empty rind?
No thought amid his slumber
He grants impending fate,
While nights and dawns keep number
In step apportionate,
And life is filched away—his poor estate.
Alas!—arise, weak mortals,
And measure all your loss!
Begirt for deathless portals,
Can souls their birthright toss
Aside, and live on shadows vain and dross?
Oh, let your eyes beholding
Yon pure celestial sphere,
Unmask the wiles enfolding
The life that flatters here—
The little day of mingled hope and fear!
What more can base earth render
Than one poor moment's pause,
Compared with that far Splendor
Where in its primal cause
Lives all that is—that shall be—and that was!
Who on yon constellation
Eternal can set gaze,—
Its silvery gradation,
Its majesty of ways,
The concord and proportion it displays,—
In argent Wonder turning
The moon doth nightly rove,
Squired by the Star of Learning
And melting Star of Love,
She trails with gentle retinue above—.
And lo! through outer spaces
Where Mars is rolled aflame!
Where Jupiter retraces
The calmed horizon's frame
And all the heavens his ray beloved acclaim!
Beyond swings Saturn, father
Of the fabled age of gold;
And o'er his shoulders gather
Night's chantries manifold,
In their proportioned grade and lustre stoled!—
Who can behold such vision
And still earth's baubles prize?
Nor sob the last decision
To rend the bond that ties
His soul a captive from such blissful skies?
For there Content hath dwelling;
And Peace, her realm; and there
Mid joys and glories swelling
Lifts up the dais fair
With Sacred Love enthroned beyond compare.
Immensurable Beauty
Shows cloudless to that light;
And there a Sun doth duty
That knows no stain of night;
There Spring Eternal blossoms without blight.
O fields of Truth-Abiding!
Green pasturelands and rills!
And mines of treasures hiding!
O joyous-breasted hills!
Re-echoing vales where every balm distils!
Now is earth's loveliness withdrawn
Unto her bosom; now the heavens are stoled
In vesture of the fading lawn;
And from the branches' lifeless hold
Leaf after leaf unto the ground is doled.
Now PhÅbus turns on sunlit tread
Along Ægean shores; the coursing day
Runs swifter; noontide is bespread
With herding of the fleeces gray
Of Éolus upon his blustery way.
By dim horizons go the cranes
Of Íbycus, migrating with their cry
Portentous; and the bullock strains
Against the yoke with shoulders high,
Turning his patient furrows to the sky.
To noble studies would the hours,
Griàl, convene us; now the voice of Fame
Calls upward to her sacred towers,
And to that summit bids us aim
Where never yet the breath of passions came.
And at her calling, bolder strides
The foot upon the mountain, so it gains
The final peak whence purest glides
The fountain without worldly stains;
Drink there thy fill, and thirst no more remains.
Then naught to thee is golden lure
That snares mankind upon a fevered quest
For that which can no more endure
Than gossamer the zephyr's breast
Is wafting light and fickle without rest.
Doth God Apollo smile?—then write;
Be peer with olden poets,—take thy stand
Above our newer bards in might;
But oh, dear friend, not hand in hand
May'st hope to clasp me on that songful strand!
For I whom whirlwinds have assailed,
And treachery from high adventuring
Down to the very grime hath haled,
Find broken —I a wounded thing—
My lyre belovèd and my soaring wing.
Resplendent precinct of the skies,
Fair sward of gladness neither snow
Nor parching breath of noonday tries,
Domain whose sacred uplands show
Its peace ungarnered deathlessly aglow!
His brows in white and azure crowned
Athwart its pastures softly wends,
O flock endeared with thee around,
The Holy Shepherd; thee He tends
Unarmed with staff or sling where naught offends.
He leads, and happy sheep o'erflow
Around Him in a loving feud,
Where the immortal roses blow
And verdure ever is renewed
Howe'er the flock may graze, in plenitude.
And now upon the mountain ways
Of Bliss He guides; now by the stream
To bathe them in His grace He strays;
Now grants them banqueting agleam—
Himself the Giver and the Gift Supreme.
And when the eye of noon attains
The zenith of its fiery powers,
Amid His fondlings He remains
To drowse away the torrid hours
And cheer with voice serene the holy bowers.
He wakes the viol's melting tone
And sweetness trembles through the soul
Unto such golden joy unknown;
Enraptured then beyond control
It casts itself on Him, its only goal.
O Breath! O Voice!—mightst Thou ordain
Some little echo for my breast
That—self-surrendering in that strain
To Thee—of Thee 'twould be possest
O Love, and on Thy shoulder find its rest!
Where Thou dost linger at the noon,
Sweet Spouse, Oh, would my spirit knew!—
And breaking from this prison swoon,
Of Thy far flocks might come in view
And stray no more, save paths Thou leadst them through.
And wouldst Thou, Holy Shepherd, leave
Thy flock within this vale of woe
And solitude to grieve,
Whilst Thou through ambient skies aglow
Ascendst where death and sorrow cannot go!
But they — so blessed in the past,
Yet now with hearts afflicted sore—
Thy little ones, outcast,
Bereft of Thee their guide of yore—
Whither shall turn they when Thou leadst no more?
What now remains to glad the eyes
That once Thy comeliness have known?
What longer can they prize?
What voices, but discordant grown
To them who hearkened to Thy loving tone?
The waves of yon perturbed deep,
Whose hand shall curb? — Who now assuage
The blasts and bid them sleep?
In Thine eclipse, — what star presage
For our benighted bark the harborage?
Alas! swift cloud unpitying
That bidst our joys no more endure,
Whither thy silvery wing?
How rich the bliss thou dost secure!—
How beggared wilt thou leave us, how obscure!—
Lo, where envy and where lies
Held me in the prison cell:
Blesséd was the lot that fell
To the humble and the wise
Far from earth's chagrins to dwell;
Who with thatch and homely fare
Rests him in some sylvan spot,
Lone with God abiding there,
And none else his thought to share,
Envying none, and envied not.
New mother of pearl bends to new cold.
Wet ash in a womb of cloud,
a sweet risk plots its drift.
An inflated tower, will the upturned brow
unearth memory from madness?
Joined to the rider who more than all
flees memory, a handkerchief by the river,
or wandering squire who restores
the north wind to the mirror and oblivion to clouds.
Scales smoothing their sound
between the foliage and the outline of the slow
tumult rasping in the mist.
Exiled it affirms itself and more thirsty
or the air returns what it refines.
Cities are images.
An exercise book suffices to create
the absurd life of poetry
in its first infancy:
Durer's astonishment cubed
and a pain that wistfully
fails to be itself.
Two white rats spin
at the speed of neurosis.
Having turned in the great world like in a cage
for precisely sixty days
I set on a single thought:
rats spinning.
White, hairy, minute sphere
split in two halves that leap to come together.
But where slash, puzzled smoothness and
pain were are now these tiny legs,
and in between dividing sexes
compensatory sexes.
Things sprout from us where we were
separate beings entirely, entirely separate.
Five minutes of hatred in total. Five minutes.
Cities equal getting lost in the same old street,
in that part of the world, never elsewhere.
What couldn't not matter
if the whole were given back in two words
the being pettily the same of the different? 
Final day sun, what great ending
for poetry and its efforts!
In the great world like in a cage
I tune a dangerous instrument.
I look at myself in the mirror and can't see my face.
I have vanished: the mirror is my face.
I have made myself vanish
 since from seeing myself too much in this broken mirror
I have lost the meaning of my face
or, having counted it so much it is now infinite to me
or the nothingness that in it, like in all things,
was hidden hides it,
the nothingness in everything like the sun in the night,
and I'm my own absence before a broken mirror.
Wheel of fortune that you turn at my expense
I was with you yesterday, queen of hearts
today I'm down to nothing in a gunpowder bed
(like I'm going to light a cigarette in your name
and return to that vice explosively)
Wheel of Medieval Fortune that up to this very day
spins with a bestial energy
Yesterday you and I made love
as though that weren't paradise
By our violence we were expelled from there
however much we may have wished
each of us to have been an innocent snake.
The wheel wins, triumphs in turning the queen
upside down, breaking the goliard´s lute
making a funeral marker
out of a few happy days.
The body can also be bent and battered
because they may leaf through it heedlessly
I am a confused heap of paper treated poorly
In the hands of he who in a waiting room
carelessly reads a magazine
which in a few days will end up
In a black polyethylene bag
Before that may happen, read in me
the last chapter of our story together
that you may know.
I who have sung only the exquisite
score of personal decorum,
today, at center stage, raise my voice
in the manner of a tenor's imitations
of the bass's deep-throated tones
to carve an ode from an epic poem.
I shall navigate through civil waves
with weightless oars, like that
patriot of yore who, with only a rifle,
rowed across the English Channel.
In a muted epic I shall tell that
our land is diamantine, impeccable.
Sweet Land: let me engulf you
in the deepest music of the jungle,
music that molded my expression,
sounds of the rhythmic cadences of axes,
young girls' cries and laughter,
and birds of the carpenter profession. 
Patria: your surface is the gold of maize,
below, the palace of gold medallion kings,
your sky is filled with the heron's flight
and green lightning of parrots' wings.
God-the-Child deeded you a stable,
lust for oil was the gift of the devil.
Above your Capital the hours soar,
hollow-eyed and rouged, in a coach-and-four,
while in your provinces the hours
roll like centavos from insomniac
clocks with fan-tail dove patrols.
Patria: your maimed terrain
is clothed in beads and bright percale.
Sweet Land: your house is still
so vast that the train rolling by seems
only a diminutive Christmas toy.
And in the tumult of the stations,
your brown-skinned face imparts
that immensity to every heart.
Who, on a dark and ominous night
has not, before he knew wrong, held
tight his sweetheart's arm to watch
the splendor of a fireworks display?
Patria: in your tropical abundance
you shimmer with the dolphin's iridescence;
the soul, an aerialist hummingbird,
plights its troth with your golden hair,
and, as offering to your tobacco braids,
my lively race of jarabe dancers
bring their honeyed maguey waters.
Your soil rings of silver, and in your hand
even poverty's piggy-bank rattles a tune,
and in early mornings across the land,
through streets like mirrors, spread
the blessed aromas of fresh-baked bread.
When we are born, you give us notes,
and compotes worthy of Paradise,
then, Sweet Land, your whole being,
all the bounty of earth and air.
To the sad and the joyful you say sí,
that on your loving tongue they savor
your tangy flavor of sesame.
When it thunders, your nuptial sky
fills us with frenzy and delight.
Thunderous clouds, that drench us
with madness, madden the mountain,
mend the lunatic, woo the woman,
raise the dead, demand the Viaticum,
and the, finally, fling God's lumber
across tilled fields shaken with thunder.
Thunderous storm: I hear in your groans
the rattling of coupled skeletons,
I hear the past and what is to come,
I hear the present with its coconut drum.
And in the sound of your coming and going
I hear life's roulette wheel, spinning, spinning
(Cuauhtémoc)
Forever-young grandfather, hear my praise
for the only hero worthy of art.
Anachronistic, farcical,
the rose bows to your nopal;
you magnetize the Spaniard's language
the spout from which flow Catholic prayers
to fill the triumphant zócalo where
the soles of your feet where scorched to ash.
Unlike Caesar, no patrician flush
suffused your face during your pain;
today, your unwreathed head appears,
hemispherically, on a coin.
A spiritual coin upon which is etched
all you suffered: the hollowed-out pirogue
of your capture, the chaos of your creatures,
the sobbing of your mythologies,
the swimming idols, and the Malinche,
but most to bewail is your having been severed
from the curved breast of the empress
as from the breast of a quail.
Suave Patria, this is your omen:
the river of virtues of your women.
Your daughters move like sylphs, or,
distilling an invisible alcohol,
webbed in the netting of your sun,
file by like graceful demijohns.
Patria, I love you not as myth
but for the communion of your truth,
as I love the child peering over the rail,
in a blouse buttoned up to her eartips
and skirt to her ankle of fine percale.
Impervious to dishonor, you flower.
I shall believe in you as long as
at the dawn hour one Mexican woman
carries home dough in her shawl,
and from the oven of its inauguration
the aroma spreads across the nation.
Like a Queen of Hearts, Patria, tapping
a vein of silver, you live miraculously,
for the day, like the national lottery.
Your image is the Palacio Nacional,
the same grandeur, and the identical
stature of a boy and a thimble.
In the face of hunger and mortar, Felipe de Jesús,
saint and martyr, will give you a fig.
Suave Patria, gentle vendor of chía,
I want to bear you away in the dark of Lent,
riding a fiery stallion, disturbing
the peace, and dodging shots from police.
Patria, your heart will always have room
for the bird a youngster tenderly
entombs in an empty spool box;
yes, in you our young hide, weeping,
the dried-apple cadavers
of birds that speak our own tongue.
If I am stifling in your July, send me
from the orchard of your hair the cool air
that brings shawls and dripping clay pitchers;
then, if I shiver, let me draw warmth
from your plump rum-punch lips
and your blue-incense breath.
Before your blessed-palm draped balcony
I pass with heavy heart, knowing
you tremble on this Palm Sunday.
Your spirit and style are dying our,
like the vanishing goddess of song
in a country fair—indomitable bosom
challenging straining bodice—
who evoked lust along with life's rhythm.
Patria, I give the key to happiness:
be faithful forever to your likeness:
fifty repeats of the Ave are carved
on the beads of the rosary, and it is
more fortunate than you, Patria suave.
Be constant, be true, your glory
your eyes of abandon and thirsting voice;
tri-color sash across misty breasts,
and an open air throne like a resonant timbrel:
allegory's straw cart!
Susana, ven: tu amor quiero gozar.
Léhar. OperetaLa casta Susana
Provincial old maids
Seved up by the years,
Reading love-story magazines
And peering into balconies and windows...
Provincial old maids,
They of the needle and thimble who do nothing
Except consume each night
CafÃ©-au-lait and papaya sweetmeats...
Who go out —if they do leave the house—
Very early on their way to church,
Walking with the domesticated waddle of a goose.
Overripe, et cetera, who sing
In a melancholy way
From sun to sun: —Susana, come... Susana
Poor old maids, poor
Old maids so useless an so chaste,
Who make the devil say
With folded arms: —Poor old maids!—
Era del año la estación florida

Tropic village night: the hours
slow and grave. The vesper bell,
and then, as the ladies return,
the musical closing of the gate...
Suddenly, the incongruous sound
of peasant clogs. And in the drowsiness
of things, what a smell of chocolate
and cheese, of yucca bread and honey-cake!
Far off in clandestine shadow,
in the rustic stable, a jackass
brays taps for his donkey love
with a friendly squeeze on his accordion...
Only the druggist, my neighbour,
keeps stolid watch behind his counter,
to sell —with a sibylline gesture—
two cents' worth of castor oil...
While the moon, from its arcane depth,
outlines the church. In its blue vault
the tumid moon is like a pimple...
And the church an enormous nursing-bottle
Sultry Sunday, noon
of shimmering
sun, A policeman
as if embedded in the curb,
profoundly asleep. A dog's
filth smeared on a fence. An abbot's
indigestion, the muffled
cacophony of a locust...
Solitude of the grave, complete
and sullen silence. But
suddenly in the ugly town
the dominical hush is broken,
for a raving drunkard screams:
Hooray for the Liberal Party!
A fragment of moon that shines
but timidly. A sailor sings,
and his sad song, rough and plain,
stammers with the tang of wine.
The sea, baffled by the shore's biceps,
has a feline sinuosity,
and it drops itself upon the beach
with the cadence of an alexandrine.
I am thinking of you, thinking that I love you,
because I am sad, because I am listening
to the small bell in the little tower
which mourns with a tender sobbing
while the toads sing about winter
with a letter from the spelling book...
O Moon, who now look over the roof
Of the church, in the tropical calm
To be saluted by him who has been out all night,
To be barked at by the dogs of the suburbs,
O moon, who in your silence have laughed at
All things! In your sidereal silence
When, keeping carefully in the shadow, the
Municipal judge steals from some den—
But you offer, saturnine traveler,
With what eloquence in mute space
Consolation to him whose life is broken,
While there sing to you from a drunken brawl
Long-haired, neurasthenic bards,
And lousy creatures who play dominos.
A Marisol
Country girl, don't stay away from the market,
you with the blond hair —cauliflower in mustard—
and those eyes, those eyes where wickedness makes its nest!...
Who wouldn't run to watch you crossing the square!
Even the village priest, that frank and simple soul,
when you appear shakes off his lazy languor!...
You are an eclogue! ..and you sing, without singing, the seeds,
the furrows, the mills, the bubbling streams
where leaves float their yellow sadness...
What do you care if that crass, that potbellied banker,
and that spinster there —old and very ugly—
do not buy from you (slaves to their useless wealth!)
your pinks and lilies lovely flower of your village...
To the devil with them ! To the garlic and
tomato with them! Let them eat rice and turtle-meat!
For you, country girl with your hat and skirt,
you, debonaire and sweet, riding by on your donkey,
give the wings and trills of a goldfinch to a crow!
The wings and trills!... And you take away the rose
of your face!... And you take away your malicious glance,
and your sweet smile which has said to me the thing
that to a glutton suggests the half-open pomegranate!...
The village mayor, in a soiled panama
With a tricolor ribbon at its crown,
Stout as Hugh Capet, in his loose eclát,
Glitters with bull-dog face across the town.
A doughty neighbor, ruddy as the tow,
His dagger's point his only signature,--
When at the night the garlic soup will flow,
He makes his girdle strap the less secure.
His wife, a nervous, pretty, little thing,
Holds him as in an iron fastening,
Cheering herself the while with Paul de Kock;
Decked in glass-beads, her eyebrows painted clear,--
The while her spouse through the backtown will steer
With stomach jewels and a face of rock.
For Margarita and her harp: twin harps.
Who plays the harp of the rain?
My heart, sprinkled, stops to listen 
to the water's music.
It stands, listening,
above the chalice of a rose.
What fingers move
over the trembling strings of the rain?
What phantom hand flings
drops of music into the air?
The heart, spellbound, listens:
The rose bends slowly under the rain.
The water plays in the moonlight
with its long diamond chains:
It laughs in the shadow, crossing
and twining and glittering, sketching radiant
scribbles of stars.
The water must be reined in
so it rises fine and high. A shiver of spray
dissolves in the air; turns to itself, descends
then, opening itself in slow feathered fans...
But it will not go far. This is sleep-walking water
dancing, walking the edge of a dream,
fettered by fleeing horizons, by nonexistent 
landscapes. Blown out by a little spigot.
Water of seven veils, always disrobing and never
naked! When will you surge to burst the marble curb
which holds you, and finally
thrust beyond yourself to pierce the Night!
From this, my Ark, groping,
I release a word into the world:
The word flies away...
and does not come back.
Island of mine, how sweet you are! how beautiful! Your sky is alive, with the warmth of angels,of the undersides of stars.
Your sea is the final home of ancient dolphins and stranded sirens.
Copper backbones brace your highlands, and magical twilights kindle the lantern of your air.
Resting place of gulls and petrels, rosary of sailors, antenna of America; you combine the tenderness of the small and the nobility of the great.
You have always been the loveliest land that human eyes can contemplate: the bride of Columbus, beloved youngest child, Paradise Found.
You are humble but proud, like Hatuey; ardent but chaste, like Guarina.
You are delightful as the fruit of your trees, the word of your Apostle.
You smell of quince and jasmine; of the clean earth, the sea, the sky.
Drawn on maps, highlighted by the intense blue of lithography, you seem like a fine gold iguana, a great fish asleep on the petals of the water.
But you also seem like the drawn bow an invisible archer raises in the shadows, aimed at our heart.
Slender island, you are garbed in dawn and rain, fanned by the land breeze, twirled by the summer solstice.
Like Diana, free and goddess, you want no other diadem than the moon; no other crest than the sun rising in your royal palm.
Evil beasts don't prosper in your gardens, and no bird has ever died there of the cold.
Idyllic bees people your tangled branches with honey; there the hummingbird murmurs as it hovers near the iris, and the mockingbird distills its living music.
Spangled with salt and starlight, you sleep, my little Island, in the Tropic night. You rock softly in the hammock of the waves.
You pin the rose of the winds at your waist; your Mays are full of fireflies; your fields are mint and your beaches sugar.
Planted in your spell-bound earth, dry twigs turn to spikenard, white flower of Saint Joseph, the wedding flower. Rocks of Moses, your stones gush with fountains.
A hidden archangel watches over your every bramble, and Jacob's ladder rises every night above the man who sleeps peacefully on your soil.
And another fine ladder also rises for him: the rosy smoke of tobacco, gladdening his rest and perfuming his path with dreams.
Brightest Island, your people find in you delight in being human, a reason for living, intimate dignity of being.
You are by far the most cordial, the most gracious. You offer yourself to everyone, fragrant and gracious as a cup of coffee; but you sell yourself to no one. Sometimes you've offered your blood like the eucharistic pelican, but never, like a dull creature of the shadows, sucked the blood of others.
Lithe and willowy island, I would love you even if some other land were mine, as those who come from the misty lands of the North Wind, or the gardens of the Mediterranean, or the distant country of the lotus also love you.
My Island, fragrant Island, flower of islands: hold me forever, give birth to me forever, pluck off all my departures one by one.
And keep the last for me, hidden under a little sun-warmed sand. On the shores of the Gulf where the hurricanes always make their mysterious nest!
I am like the traveler
who arrives at a port where no one waits for him;
I am the shy traveler who walks
among other people's embraces and smiles
which are not for him...
Like the lone traveler
who turns up the collar of his overcoat
in the chill of the great wharf...
The afternoon, with light strokes
that lit the peace of our asylum,
sketched in chrysoberylic shades
a subtle violet decoration.
The moon surged enormous in the thicket;
the leaves increased their secret;
and a spider, on the point of its thread,
was weaving hypnotized above the spheric moon.
Bats filled the crooked arc
of sky, as on a Chinese screen;
your bloodless knees against the plinth
revealed our motionless delight,
at our feet a sapphire river
ran in silence toward its death.
Amid the glory of the sun, the world
A-tremble lifts in tossing clouds and blue
Melodious architraves, with towers unfurled
Like festal banners to the daylight's view.
Afar prophetic, sounds the cock's loud call
Hierophant before the gates of light;
Amid his radiant canticle stirs all
His emerald plumage in its joyous might.
And every little pebble shines with gold;
The harvest fields exhale their fragrant heat;
Swept are the woods with waves of shadows old;
Day is like bread, a blessing clean and sweet.
Memories cross us at night like distant
Trains through the fields of the soul.
They flee from us. We feel them. Time drives them
to the remote sleepwalking darkness.
We remain silent, like lonely stations,
cold in the naked dawn.
God is sometimes just the yellow eyelid
of that one light that does not go out.
Deaf, in what deep sidings of oblivion
the wagons of sleep run up and run aground
in the immobility of darkness
while life goes on whistling in the distance.
Sidings of oblivion, where the switchmen
of time sink laughter and hope.
Rusty rails where it is not possible
walk towards dawn.
Oh sad siding
where does condemned joy go,
in which it definitely derails
that childhood toy train.
It is like the water in generous graces
for the humble coolness of the sand:
dawn defoliating of damp roses,
liquid flourish that sounds of love.
You just flow, you spill
in loving offering by my shore.
Of burning water or flowing flames
you leave affectad this human clay.
As in the humid earth I have footprints
over me of your transparent step,
and shining pebbles, like stars,
illuminated under your stream.
Look at the water. Behold yourself. In the background
from my soul, love, the same flow.
I look at the water. I look at you. And deep down
of time, perhaps, like water you get away.
A chilly and overcast afternoon
in winter. The students
are studying. Steady boredom
of raindrops across the windowpanes.
It is time for class. In a poster
Cain is shown running
away, and Abel dead,
not far from a red spot.
The teacher, with a voice husky and hollow,
is thundering. He is an old man badly dressed
withered and dried up,
who is holding a book in his hand.
And the whole childrens choir
is singing its lesson:
one thousand times one hundred is one hundred thousand
one thousand times one thousand is one million
of raindrops across the window panes.
Daydreams have endlessly turning
paths going over the bitter
earth, winding roads,
parks flowering, in darkness and in silence;
deep vaults, ladders against the stars;
scenes of hopes and memories.
Tiny figures that walk past and smile
—sad playthings for an old man—;
friends we think we can see
at the flowery turn in the road
and imaginary creatures
that show us roads... far off...
Never was a man, ever
So bent to pleasure, more
Driven to pain.
Never has one fallen with such
Countenance, that of so
Victorious a loser.
Oh, he was as keen to go to waste
As others are to win.
And so he missed
His life,
For want of love and
For having given so much.
Better to die and forget
Than to love and to live.
It's more worthy to let go
Than to achieve.
It was much like a sigh languid and deep,
The sea's rumble that evening... The day,
Refusing to let go, clung from the cliffs
With golden claws.
Then the sea raised its bosom mightily,
The sun at last sinking in the waves,
Its gilt forehead reclining in a magnificent bed,
Melting away in opalescent embers.
For my poor aching body,
For my sad lacerate soul,
For my distressed, stiff heart,
For my bitter, weary life
The sea much beloved, the sea so coveted,
The sea, the sea, and nothing else to care for!...
The little old lady laughs like a little girl, going
On with the tale of this and that happy day.
Says the little old lady, Oh, what times were they
When I fell in love without Grandmother's knowing!
The little old lady is a little rogue, showing
A malicious twinkle in the depths of her eyes.
How distinct the silver of her hair one descries
Against the caramel-tinted skin glowing.
The little old lady forgets how dull or shady
Life may be; and the wrinkles laugh over her face.
Sweet tremors through her blessed old body race:
And my dear looks at me and I look at my dear,
And we laugh, and we laugh... all the while we hear
The white history of the loves of the little old lady.
At the end of this journey
I have leant my dreams
over the balustrade of her name.
The turbid water of shadow
has gotten into the night
up to our hearts.
—Immobile crowds
are besieging the horizon.—
I have clutched her image
against my grief,
and the moon, supported in windowpanes,
is the cool
thaw
of her forehead.
An unexpected perfume
stirs her up in my memory;
her attitude of sweetness
has Latin filing.
O her Platonic flesh,
geometry that rests in her bust—!
Her smile is the flower of organic harmony,
and the countryside
thrills her,
within my panoramic
embrace.
But all the same,
the tenant
autumn
irrigated her remembrance with dry leaves.
O my distant girlfriend,
romantic cloud of smoke
from the first verses.
Path of other dreams we walked with evening;
a strange affair
deflowered us in the bliss of the flesh,
and my heart fluctuates
between her and the desolation of the journey.
In the throng of the platforms
sobs broke out all of a sudden;
afterward, all night,
I hear her laments
and her appeals
beneath my dreams.
The train is an iron gust
that ravages the scene and which unsettles everything.
I drain her remembrance
down to the bottom
of ecstasy,
and the faraway colors
of her eyes beat in my chest.
Today we go out together in the autumn
and the meadows will be yellow.
I thrill for her!
Uninhabited horizons of absence!
Tomorrow all will be
clouded with her tears,
and the lifetime that comes
is faint as a breath.
I myself am a station of sentiments
and the goodbyes whistle like trains.
It is useless to cry.
In the outlines of dusk,
windows ablaze
toward new
directions.
The vesperal
skylark
of her handkerchief
still
flutters.
The allusive garden is blurred with delays
and the heart awakens to the last things.
A breath of victrolas
blows its glassy murmurs
toward us.
Poets discuss the days withdrawal.
Vagrant streets return from exile.
A faint hope carried me away to her caresses;
her sudden image thrills me to the depths;
her whiteness nests in the latent evening,
and while she loosens her bosom of sighs
trees illuminate our cosmic secret.
Absence is the perfume she leaves on my chest.
I lose that absence in the thicket
of modern life,
and I return once again,
to the playing field with its authentic moons.
I wager her smile in the game of poker,
musical interpretations inundated with tears.
When I place the voucher of my farewell
in her hands,
somnambulist express trains
see our shadows off,
and the seasickness of ports within the heart.
(Springtime ticks off
its lessons).
All of a sudden the obscure denouement of the cell.
I will compromise with birds over her bleeding remembrance.
Our steps came as far as the gunwale of evening;
the Atlantic sings below the docks,
and it presages a reflection of women
that smile at the commerce
of new lands.
The smoke of boats
enervates the landscape;
hazy crossing
flowering from steamer funnels,
O fair transient of the maritime zones!
all of a sudden, you are the loose
image of the aquarium.
There is an ardent traffic on avenues
opposite the hotel fanned with palms.
You lean out through the lattice
of songs
to the port pounding with motors
and colors of distance
face me in your tender eyes.
Among the poisonous vines
that entangle sleep
I pick up her amorous signals;
bliss awaits us
in the bright summer of her kisses;
the ocean of caresses kneels her down,
and the piano
is a hammock on the boulevard.
She joins the moon there in the masts,
and an ashen wind
carries me her name;
the sailing hectic with handkerchiefs,
and goodbyes score our breasts,
and in the dim memory of all of these pleasures,
only the petals of her thrill
perfume the shores of night.
The wind is the apostle of this forbidden hour.
O faded eras
that shook off their final autumns—!
Their remembrance senses hopeless impending
horizons of birds,
and corollas defoliate their keyboard.
Absolute wind blows against cosmic
matter; music
is the propaganda that floats in balconies,
and the landscape stands out
in weathervanes.
Wind, iron
dictatorship
that thrills the confederations—!
O the blue
and resounding
masses, that rise
up to their hearts—!
Evening is a bloody mutiny
on the outskirts;
ragged trees
that cry out for alms in windows;
industrial plants swelter
in the conflagration of dusk,
and in the brilliant sky
aircraft
execute vesperal maneuvers.
Rousing banners
will repeat their proletarian harangue
facing the cities.
At the romantic meeting of departure,
where we all weep
today I garner respite from her rendezvous;
the season
ripped to pieces remains within her hands,
and her swoon
is the high point of the farewell.
I kiss the photograph of her memory
and the terrified train moves off within shadow,
while I strip the leaves off new paths.
Soon we will come to the mountains.
O gentle geography
of our Mexico,
her avionic landscapes,
ineffable heights of political
economy; smoke of factories
lost in the fog
of time,
and eclectic rumors
of uprisings.
Night inside
the soldiers,
they tear
folk songs
from their breasts.
The enemy
artillery, it spies on us
at the margins of Nature;
subterranean noises
people our fear
and the scene collapses.
Military trains
that go toward the four cardinal points,
to the baptism with blood
where all is confusion,
and drunken men
play at cards
and at human sacrifice;
loud and martial trains
where we make singing Revolution.
Never have I felt so close to death as now.
We pass the evening alongside the intact light of reminiscence,
but the others arrive without warning
extinguishing the concept of things,
the tender images at the edge of the horoscope.
There, far away,
pregnant women
have stayed behind petitioning
for us
to the Stone Crucifixes.
After the massacre
the wind once again
shoos away
the fallen leaves of dreams.
I shake the daybreak of my verses
over enemy hearts,
and the icy touch of centuries
strokes me on the forehead,
while the anguish of silence
flows through the essences of cherished names.
Aboard the express train
we fly over the unreality of the continent.
Evening muted in mirrors,
and farewells bleed in my mind.
Throughout this journey,
my nostalgic heart presages
vagrant literatures
that shook the feathers
from their wings,
on the chill corridors of the landscape.
They go past somnambulist countrysides
while the train moves off within the tunnels of sleep.
There, from time to time,
cities
stoned by screams and goodbyes.
Rivers of poppies
that come from the depth of the years,
proceed interminably,
under bridges,
which affirmed
their metallic waterfall
over the slopes.
Afterwards, mountains, silent armies
howl at death.
Between cracks of the night
the insomnia of a star torments me.
Trains that travel ever toward absence,
one day,
without knowing it,
we will pass each other
in the country.
I am only in the final stretch of absence,
and distress, horizon ago in my dementia.
the wicked panorama,
I myself abandoned the resonant Confederation of her flesh!
Above all her voice,
shattered
within music
pipes—!
In the forbidden garden
—unanimous astonishment—
the deep-frozen auditorium of the moon.
Her remembrance is only a reverberation
within the architecture of insomnia.
God,
I have my hands full of blood!
And aircraft,
birds of these aesthetic climes,
will not write her name
in the water of the sky.
To the workers of Mexico
Heres my brutal
and multispirited
poem
to the new city.
O city all tense
with cables and with efforts,
all resounding
with motors and with wings.
Simultaneous explosion
of new theories,
a bit further
On the spatial plane
from Whitman and from Turner
and a bit closer
to Maples Arce.
The lungs of Russia
blow the wind
of social revolution toward us.
Literary zipper-robbers
will understand nothing
of this new sweaty
beauty of the century,
and the ripe
moons
that fell,
are this putrefaction
that reaches us
from intellectual sewage pipes.
Heres my poem:
O city strong
and manifold,
made all of iron and of steel!
Docks. Inner harbors.
Cranes.
And the sexual fever
of industrial plants.
Metropolis:
Bodyguards of trams
that traverse the subversivist streets.
Window displays accost sidewalks,
and the sun, it sacks the avenues.
On the fringes of the tariffed
days of telephone posts
momentary landscapes file
through systems of elevator tubes.
Suddenly,
O the green
flash of her eyes!
Beneath the ingenuous shutters of the hour
pass red battalions.
The cannibal romanticism of Yankee music
has gone making its nests in the masts.
O international city!
Toward what remote meridian
cut that ocean liner?
I feel that everything moves away.
Aged dusks
float among the masonry of the scene.
Spectral trains that travel
toward far
away, panting with civilizations.
The upset multitude
sloshes musically in the streets.
And now, the bourgeois thieves, they will lie down to tremble
for the fortunes
that robbed the town,
but someone concealed beneath their dreams
the spiritual music staff of the explosive.
Pennants of hurrahs into the wind,
inflamed heads of hair
and captive mornings in eyes.
O musical
city
all made of mechanical rhythms!
Tomorrow, perhaps,
only the vivid light of my verses
will illuminate the humiliated horizons.
La tarde, acribillada de ventanas,
flota sobre los hilos del teléfono,
y entre los atravesaños
inversos de la hora
se cuelgan los adioses de las máquinas.
Su juventud maravillosa
estalló una mañana
entre mis dedos,
y en el agua vacía
de los espejos,
naufragaron los rostros olvidados.
¡Oh la pobre ciudad sindicalista
andamiada
de hurras y de gritos!
Los obreros
son rojos
y amarillos.
Hay un florecimiento de pistolas
después del trampolín de los discursos,
y mientras los pulmones
del viento
se supuran,
perdida en los obscuros pasillos de la música
alguna novia blanca se deshoja.
Among copses of silence
darkness licks the blood of dusk.
Fallen stars,
they are dead birds
in the dreamless water
of the mirror.
And the resounding
artilleries of the Atlantic
waned,
finally,
in the distance.
Over the rigging of autumn,
a nocturnal wind blows:
it is the wind of Russia,
of the great tragedies,
and the garden,
yellow,
founders in shadow.
Her recollection, sudden,
it crackles in muted interiors.
Her golden words
sift in my memory.
Rivers of blue shirts
overflow the floodgates of industrial plants,
and agitator trees
gesticulate their discourses on the sidewalk.
The strikers fling
insults and blows with stones,
and life, it is a tumultuous
conversion to the left.
On the edges of the pillow,
night, it is a precipice;
and insomnia,
it has remained rummaging in my brain.
From whom are those voices
that float in shadow?
And these trains that howl
to devastated horizons.
The soldiers
will spend this night in the inferno.
My God!
And from all this disaster
only a few white
pieces
of her recollection,
they have kept me within her hands.
When in the light of the Argentine Sky,
You read these words, chaste beauty,
I wish in your virginal soul there were a memory
For the poor outlaw who wrote it;
And may a memory of you compensate him
Of the oblivion of all in his homeland!
Fill the soul with memories
Sighing the heart,
Let go of my eyes
A teardrop of love.
Oh! it was a dew drop
That in the night was lost;
Not a flower opened its chalice
To that tear of love!
You who enjoy when you pay
With disdain my passion,
It was more yours than yourself
That teardrop of love.
Oh, you kill me and you please
But the just God avenge me;
you can't imagin the price
of a teardrop of love!!
I cultivate a white rose
In July as in January
For the sincere friend
Who gives me his hand frankly.
And for the cruel person who tears out
the heart with which I live,
I cultivate neither nettles nor thorns:
I cultivate a white rose.
I went rowing in my rowboat
all around a charming lake
with a golden glowing sunshine
in my soul and on my face,
when, offended by an odor,
I looked quickly down, agape,
for a fish, long dead and smelly
lay there stinking up the place.
Let the thunder burst,
Pour out and drink the wine!
Thou never sawst a thunderbolt
Strike the tender vine.
Vesuvius himself
To Bacchus tribute pays,
And spares the vineyard flourishing,
Where his lava sways.
In Italy in vain
I hero sought or sage;
Mine eyes but dusty ruins found,
Mouldering with age.
Of Rome the image scarce
Remains to be portrayd;
A tomb is Herculaneum,
Pompeii is a shade.
But I found Falernum,
His nectar rich remaind,
And in memory of Horace,
A bottleful I draind.
Wandering among abstruse and upper circles,
or else, simply alive and paradoxical
(all wisdom or all contradiction)
you pass, although you have returned to the "eternal uses
of the earth," this time even more categorical,
as in Barbarossa's final incarnation.
I will follow your trail with the zeal of the hound,
among the rhythmic stars or the earth-molded human,
wherever you are now repeating, Walt Whitman, 
the autochthonous canticles of your iron land 
Whether you are in the banner of the stars and stripes,
or at the iron gate where the serfs are rebelling,
or at the post that watches upstanding in defiance,  
or at the nuptial exchange which the morning revives,
or with the sailors' crew taking arms and uprising 
or in the trampling of bisons crossing the darkness,
or in the endless void where silence and death reign,
receive this salutation cast to the wind and the sky
with the certain impression of embracing you briefly
and the agonizing fear of losing you again.
And so many quiet phrases
which go to sleep in a cloud of dust
And the design of the silk
in the astonished look
Reminiscent coral
which the invader never invokes.
And the prelude of the mouth
in the fatal fragrance.
Garden of the mournful moon.
Old stone that gets lost.
And the argument so green
Of the island that hounds me
like a divine remedy.
Maybe the fluctuant saying
elongates in the hiker
that is left without a road.
The moon, mysterious, pilgrim,
between shadow and twilight shines;
pale trembles on the dark mountain
and white light scatters on the hill.
In the deep valleys it illuminates
nascent flower, green leaf, hard rock;
and angels fly through the pure aura
and to the soul there was a divine vision.
Our earthly souls their restless
worries with the moon satisfy,
and are they guided by the attraction of the planets?
Ah, crazy dreams that are born in the mind,
countries that poets imagine,
lost moons that lie in their twilight!
Wound me, O Death!
Gather the open flower
of my years. Let it not
age. Come soon.
Break the crimson coil
of my ambitious heart in full
flight over the curved horizons.
Paralyze my arms
that dip the oar in the golden waters
of time. And bind my feet
stained with the blood of the carnal
grape-cluster. Quench the rhythm
of my arteries whose beat wounds,
in the sleepless night, my cars
with a rumour of underground water.
Bandage me
like a child, and deliver me to the arms
of the dark wet-nurse who suckles
the hungry roots of the trees.
Not to see the light, the creative light
that draws from its inexhaustible depths
the infinite forms of life.
Not to stare into space
potable to the gaze
like a blue cup full of foam.
Never to see a human face,
never to hear a word.
Wound me, O Death.
Neither the gentle sea, wrecker of many
riches, keeping beneath, its waters
fabulous cities
drowned, like funeral vessels
with their cups of gold
and their couches laden with women.
Nor the same sky forever that sustains
clouds' mobile architecture,
tracing the distant measure
of mysterious constellations,
Nor the adolescent body
of a young girl, just shaded
along its hidden creases
by a soft velvet down.
Nothing can bind me to this shore
of earth.
Come, O Death!
I would descend the dank stairs,
carpeted with moss, of the narrow
gallery that leads to your crypt
where the drowsy sphynic is waiting
crowned with immortal roses.
There, in the glimmer of the fading lamps
that filter a shadowy dawn
through the grey alabaster?
I will review the multiple scene
of my life, the faces known,
the golden image of certain fields
still blooming, under other skies,
lost in time and memory.
I saw them break apart these level fields,
and grow, I saw, and break in a few months
this yesterday, Sorino, ruddy grain,
scant handsfull now of tassles hoar and worn.
These I saw that now are straw so proud,
their leaves unfolding so that you might see
the emerald bested on their underside,
the pearls within their bundles in the morn.
Once sprouted, grew, then seed and kernels formed
what you see with the sickle now brought down,
what then so much like something else did seem.
What are we, then, what are we? Counterpart
of this: ripe grain, Sorino, later crop;
and how many without seed have been gleaned!
These that yield up bread vast fields today,
were once Italica. This plain was shrine.
To Theodosius here, to Trajan there
raised statues their victorious fatherland.
In this precinct Lamia and Flora were
the flame and idol of the masses vain;
in this precinct the proudest warrior
the voice waited to hear of clapping hands.
How all did die, alas! but there, upright,
in spite of time and fortune, here and there,
those oft-contested stones we still can see.
If they can conquer time and the extremes
of evil, silent and long suffering stones,
we'll suffer too, my love, and silent be.
I love to see the ocean when it's angry,
and mountains builds of water upon mountains,
and the well-travelled pilot (who must hide,
so prudently, his fear) beset with doubt.
I also love to see it when it bathes
the shore so slightly, flattering in milk
one who is lead by guilt, or by his greed,
some scarlet Cardinal's hat to ferret out.
I love it rough, and when it is serene;
to safely see it, I say, from without,
and this man frightened see, that one deceived. 
not because their ill luck pleases me,
but knowing that I'm free upon the shore,
and of the false sea finally undeceived.
I'll see time take upon you, lady mine,
my vengeance when your loveliness it steals;
I'll see your hair turned into purest snow,
which art and youth now curl and tinge with gold;
and in place of roses, with which age,
alas, so insecure, now dyes your cheeks,
lilies in your later years will come
to free Flora from pain and envy cold.
But when unseeing time the cutting edge
of your great beauty dulls, and when the breath
away from your now sovereign mouth it steals,
you'll still see my wound boil, my fire burn:
for neither flames die when the wind is calm;
nor does the wound, once dulled the weapon, heal.
The works of human artifice soon tire
The curious eye; the fountains sparkling rill,
And gardens, when adorned by human skill,
Reproach the feeble hand, the vain desire.
But oh! the free and wild magnificence
Of Nature, in her lavish hours, doth steal,
In admiration silent and intense,
The soul of him who hath a soul to feel.
The river moving on its ceaseless way,
The verdant reach of meadows fair and green,
And the blue hills, that bound the sylvan scene,
These speak of grandeur, that defies decay,—
Proclaim the Eternal Architect on high,
Who stamps on all his works his own eternity.
I applied myself to science,
In its great truths believing,
That from my troubles I hence
Some ease might be receiving.
O! what a sad delusion!
What lessons dear I learnd me!
To verses in conclusion,
And mirth and dance I turnd me.
As if it were that life could
Produce so little trouble,
That we with toils and strife would
Make each one of them double.
I stand by smiling Bacchus,
In joys us wont to wrap he;
The wise, Dorila, lack us
The knowledge to be happy.
What matters it, if even
In fair as diamond splendour,
The sun is fixd in heaven?
Me light hes born to render.
The moon is, so me tell they,
With living beings swarmy;
There may be thousands, well they
Can never come to harm me!
From Danube to the Ganges,
History tells how did he
The Macedonian launch his
Proud banner fierce and giddy!
Whats that to us, to entice us,
If only half this valley,
To feed our lambs suffice us,
With all our wants to tally?
If not, leave all to justice:
Give me some drink, oerpowerd
With but to name this goddess,
I feel myself a coward.
They much who study ever
Have thousand plagues annoy them;
Which in their best endeavour
Their peace and joy destroy them:
And then what do they gather?
A thousand doubts upspringing,
Which other puzzlings farther
Them other doubts are bringing.
And so through life they haste on,
One enviable truly!
Disputes and hates to waste on,
And neer agreeing throughly.
My shepherd girl! but bring me
Then wine abundant very,
And fear not songs Ill sing thee,
As endlessly and merry.
When able happily am I
To my poor village to escape,
From all the citys noise to fly,
And cares of every shape;
Like a new man my spirits give
Me then to feel, in joyous link;
For only then I seem to live,
And only then to think.
The insufferable hours that there
In weariness to me returnd,
Now on a course so gently bear,
Their flight is scarce discernd.
The nights that there in sloth and play
Alone their occupations keep,
Here with choice books I pass away,
And in untroubled sleep.
With the first dawn I wake, to change
Rejoiced the soft beds balmy rest,
Through the life-giving air to range,
That free dilates the breast.
It pleases me the heavens to view,
Oerspread with red and golden glows,
When first his lustres to renew,
His splendours Phbus shows.
It pleases me, when bright his rays,
Above the zenith fiery shine,
To lose me in the thick woods maze,
And in their shade recline.
When languidly he hides his head,
In last reflection, even then
The mountain heights I eager tread,
To follow him again.
And when the night its mantle wide
Extends around of beaming lights,
Their motions, measuring as they glide,
My watchful eye recites.
Then to my books returnd, with awe,
My wondering thoughts, to trace, rehearse
The course of that portentous law,
That rules the universe.
From them, and from the lofty height
Of such my thoughts, I then descend
To where my rustic friends await,
My leisure to attend.
And with them taking up the part,
They give me in their toils and cares
To share, with jokes that merry start,
Away the evening wears.
About his crops one tells me all,
Another all about his vines,
And what their neighbours may befall
Each many a tale combines.
I ponder oer each sage advice;
Their proverbs carefully I store;
Their doubts and quarrels judge concise,
As arbitrator oer.
My judgements all extol they free,
And all together talking loud;
For innocent equality
Reigns in their breasts avowd.
Then soon the servant comes to bring
The brimming jugs, and next with these
The mirthful girl supplies the ring
With chestnuts, and the cheese.
And all, in brotherly content,
Draw nearer round, to pass untold
The sparkling cups, that wine present
Of more than three years old.
And thus my pleasant days to pass,
In peace and happiness supreme,
(For so our tastes our pleasures class,)
But like a moment seem.
When I was yet a child,
A child Dorila too,
To gather there the flowerets wild,
We roved the forest through.
And gaily garlands then,
With passing skill displayd,
To crown us both, in childish vein,
Her little fingers made.
And thus our joys to share,
In such our thoughts and play,
We passd along, a happy pair,
The hours and days away.
But evn in sports like these,
Soon age came hurrying by!
And of our innocence the ease
Malicious seemd to fly.
I knew not how it was,
To see me she would smile;
And but to speak to her would cause
Me pleasure strange the while.
Then beat my heart the more,
When flowers to her I brought;
And she, to wreathe them as before,
Seemd silent, lost in thought.
One evening after this
We saw two turtle-doves,
With trembling throat, who, wrapt in bliss,
Were wooing in their loves.
In manifest delight,
With wings and feathers bowd,
Their eyes fixd on each other bright,
They languishd, moaning loud.
The example made us bold,
And with a pure caress,
The troubles we had felt we told,
Our pains and happiness.
And at once from our view
Then, like a shadow, fled
Our childhood and its joys, but new,
Love gave us his instead.
If, as thou sayst, thou lovest me well,
Dear girl, those scornfulnesses cease;
For love can neer in union dwell
With such asperities.
Show sharp disdain, to plight if eer
Another proffers thee his troth;
To two at once to listen fair
Is an offence to both.
Let one be chosen, so to prove
How great your happiness may be;
Thou calmly to enjoy his love,
And he to love thee free;
Above all maids to extol thee most;
And thou to tenderness incline,
To yield repaying him the boast
His love gives forth for thine.
Reserve and rigour to preside
In love, is like the ice in spring,
That robs fair May of all its pride,
The flocks of pasturing:
But kindness, like the gentle rain,
Which April gives to glad the field,
Which makes all flourishing the plain,
And seeds their stores to yield.
Be not disdainful then, but kind:
Know not to certain beauteous eyes
Alone all beauty is confined,
Or locks of golden dyes.
Vain puffd-up beauty will appear,
But like some showy ivy stem;
They may surprise, but fruitless, neer
Have any valuing them.
If joind with kindness, like the vine
It seems, with fruitful stores arrayd;
Where all contentedly recline,
Beneath its peaceful shade:
And whose green stems, the elm around,
When twining with adorning grace
Its leaves, will hold it also bound,
Firm in its fond embrace.
Flower of a day is beautys bloom;
Time leaves it soon behind: if eer
Thou doubtst my word, let Celias doom
The lesson true declare.
Celia, for witching beauty famed
Once far and wide, so foolish proud,
A thousand captives who contemnd
That all before her bowd,
Now worn by years would blindly try
Who to her service may be won;
But finds all from her turn to fly,
To look at her finds none.
For with her snow and rose the beams
And lustre of her eyes are flown,
And like a witherd rose-tree seems,
Sad, wrinkled and alone.
Tis but ingenuous kindness true,
The maid that loves in honours bonds,
Who listens to her lover sue,
And tenderly responds;
Who at his pleasantries will smile,
Who dances with him at the feast,
Receives the flowers his gift, the while
His love with like increased;
Who him her future husband sees,
Is neither coy nor feels ashamed,
For he as hers, and she as his,
The village through are named,
That always like the dawn will seem,
When calm its light shines oer the plain,
And keeping all beneath her beam
Bound captive in her chain:
Years without clouding pass away;
Care to oppress her neer affects;
Evn rivalry forgives her sway,
And envys self respects.
Her cheerfulness and happy vein,
Being to latest age to share,
Delight of all the shepherd train,
Enchantment of the fair.
Be then, my Amaryllis! kind;
Cease those disdainfulnesses, cease;
For with thy pleasing grace combined
Such harshness ill agrees.
The heavens neer formd thee perfect thus,
Surpassingly of matchless cost,
That such high gifts should ruinous
Be miserably lost.
Be kind, receive thy lovers vow,
And all the village thou wilt find,
Who murmur at thy coldness now,
To praise thee then as kind.
Thus sang Belardo, at her door,
His shepherd girl to wait upon,
Who scornful, from her casement oer,
Bids him be silent and begone.
"Love crowned me with his myrtle crown; my name 
Will be pronounced by many, but, alas, 
When his pangs caused me bliss, not slighter woe 
The mournful suffering that consumed my frame! 
His sweet snares conquer the lorn mind they tame, 
But do not always then continue sweet; 
And since they cause me ruin so complete, 
Turn, lovers, turn, and disesteem his fame; "
We in this radiant circle looked so long 
That we found out Macías; in a bower 
Of cypress was he weeping still the hour 
That ended his dark life and love in wrong. 
Nearer I drew for sympathy was strong 
In me, when I perceived he was from Spain;
And there I heard him sing the saddest strain 
That e'er was tuned in elegiac song.
"But even as some assassin or night-rover, 
Seeing his fellow wound upon the wheel, 
Awed by the agony resolves with zeal 
His life to 'mend, and character recover; 
But when the fearful spectacle is over, 
Reacts his crimes with easy unconcern; 
So my amours on my despair return, 
That I should die, as I have lived, a lover!"
"Dangers so passionate be glad to miss; 
Learn to be gay; flee from sorrows touch; 
Learn to disserve him you have served so much, 
Your devoirs pay at any shrine but his: 
If the short joy that in his service is, 
Were but proportioned to the long, long pain, 
Neither would he that once has loved complain, 
Nor he that ne'er has loved despair of bliss. "
Son of that divine spirit;
that from his illustrious prison unleashed,
he will be eternal centuries laureate
on the sapphire of the crystalline sky,
Go out, go out into the world, and pilgrim
(which must be the well communicated)
On wings of Fame you will have walked
Being an emulation of the Sun, the same road.
If the Thracian lyre has a seat
in the high images, and it still burns
daring her light, to make two suns,
You lose your place, for being born late:
but if star, no, of the firmament
you are the light of the Spanish wits.
The golden butterfly wanted to start fly
but -fragile winged flower- fell in a tree,
while Don Pedro, absorbed, was watching sky;
alone smoking, facing the endless sea!
Such a small country, spread on an isthmus
where the sky is clearer, the sun brighter;
all your music echoes within me, like the sea
in the small cell of the conch.
Yet again, there are times I feel dread
when I dont see the way back to you¦
Perhaps Id never have known such love,
if destiny hadnt carried me over the sea.
La Patria is memory¦Scraps of life
wrapped in ribbons of love or of pain;
the murmur of palms, the commonplace songs,
the garden, stripped of its flowers.
La Patria is a map of old winding trails,
that, from childhood, I tramped without pause,
on which stand the ancient familiar trees
that talk to us of the soul in times long past.
Instead of these towers, arrowed with gold,
where the sun comes to lose its heart,
leave me the old trunk where I carved a date,
where I stole a kiss, where I learned to dream.
Oh, my ancient towers, beloved and remote:
I feel such nostalgia for your pealing bells!
I have seen many towers, heard many bells,
but have known none, my distant towers,
to sing like you, to sing and to weep.
Such a small country, all of you will fit
beneath the shadow of our flag: perhaps
you were so pretty, to ensure Id carry you
everywhere in my heart!
Desolación (1922)   
Original version
By hungry beasts chased
Wild foal cross the plains,
And tied up with strong string
On his shoulders Mazzepa is lying.
For the race at last fainted
The brute falls on the hard bushes,
And free from his tight chain,
Mazzepa rises anointed king.
So America moans between strings
To the rude colonial colt tied,
by the pack of sighthounds followed,
And inanimate, lacerated and bloodied
She runs, falls, gets up, laurels brings,
She glows her forehead crowned.
Reapers, out, out,
let the spigaderuela reach.
Who spike will become
and it will cost what it will cost
because in his hands he will enjoy
the roses that make your face
by August spring.
If in the hands that I bless
I was an ear of wheat,
make me flour I say
and then cake or bodigo
because later I ate.
If I saw myself in your hands
pearls returned the grains,
because in galan rings
on his sovereign fingers
eternally walk.
Ah, if only the village were so small
that all the streets passed by my door.
I wish I had a window
that would be the center of the world,
and a sorrow
like that of the magnolia-flower,
which darkens when you touch it.
Why does the village not  have a wall
surrounding it
until the day of her death,
or a turbulent river encircling it
to guard the girl from Velazquez.
Ah, her steps are like the dove's,
tranquil;
for friendship's sake I always imagine her alone,
holding in one of her hands a balloon
full of water
in which the fragility of destiny can be seen
and the continuity of life.
Her voice
is so gentle that in its atmosphere
sad grief heals,
as also in poems:
from her hair
the night is born,
and the dawn from her hands.
What piety, or sweetness, will they be used to,
the things she looks at
or things familiar to her,
like the incense,
the lemon-jellies,
the longing
with which I look at her.
Why doesn't the village have
an aqueduct
there, behind it,
so that the landscape her eyes see
is watered,
and she never grows tired of looking at it.
I know her goodness
has more hours than the day,
and that all her thoughts pass between dawn
and dusk,
touching her.
The days that pass make her grow.
What horizon will be closest
to her heart,
so that I can take each of my steps
toward it,
although hope stays barefoot.
Who will rescue her from chastity,
while I hope only
that in her voice,
some day, she comes to hear me...
Who could fall asleep, as a child falls asleep;
smile between dreams to the dream of pain;
and dream of friends and dream of affection;
and slowly sink into a greater dream.
And walk through life sleepwalking,
eyes wide open on an inner world,
with sealed lips, eternally mute,
attentive only to the rhythm of your own heart ...
And go through life without leaving a trace...
To be the poor stream that evaporates in the sun...
and lose one night, as a star dies,
that burned thousands of years, and that nobody saw it...
What can a table do by itself
against the roundness of the earth?
It already has enough to do allowing nothing to tumble,
allowing the chairs to converse softly
and in turn to come together on time.
If time blunts the knives,
dismisses and brings diners,
varies the topics, the words,
what can the pain of its wood do?
What can it do about the cost of things,
about the atheism of the supper,
of the last supper?
If the wine is spilt, if bread is wanting
and people grow absent,
what can it do but remain motionless, rooted
between hunger and the hours,
with what intervenes though it should wish?
To be here, for years, on the earth,
with the clouds that arrive, with the birds,
suspended in fragile hours.
On board, almost adrift,
closer to Saturn, more distant,
while the sun goes round and pulls us
and the blood runs on in its ephemeral universe
more sacred than all the stars.
To be here on the earth: no further
than a tree, no more unexplainable,
lithe in autumn, bloated in summer,
with what we are or are not, with the shadow,
the memory, the desire, till the end
(if there is an end) voice to voice
house after house,
whether who gains the earth, if they gain it,
or who hopes for it, if they wait for it,
sharing at each table the bread
between two, between three, between four,
without forgetting the leftovers of the ant
that always travels from remote stars
to be present at the hour of our supper
although the crumbs are always bitter.
The earth turned to bring us closer,
it spun on itself and within us,
and finally joined us together in this dream
as written in the Symposium.
Nights passed by, snowfalls and solstices;
time passed in minutes and millennia.
An ox cart that was on its way to Nineveh
arrived in Nebraska.
A rooster was singing some distance from the world,
in one of the thousand pre-lives of our fathers.
The earth was spinning with its music
carrying us on board;
it didn't stop turning a single moment
as if so much love, so much that's miraculous
was only an adagio written long ago
in the Symposium's score.
In the name of God we abandoned signs in the air.
What was left to us was to live, to live without bonds,
in the name of no one. We dont bet on him
(we, who never bet), but we were young,
or the words still had light, words
of a few strange verses
that the heart encoded.
The afternoon was a child we embraced,
laughing in the false morning, and the alcohol
and its exciting silver, which later wearies and scratches,
made us walk without direction, without hurry.
It was sweet not to have a beginning, let alone a destiny.
It was sweet to be in the open air, to cross time,
to be life that doesnt know or is only born
creating bodies that sleep like good oranges
behind the eyes.
But the night arrived, the last one, terrible and without warning,
to mow down our glances and to leave of love only asphalt.
The cities were and insomnia and any soul became small
in their reservoirs. Goodbye and blood,
continuous goodbye the gestures, verbs and days.
We had nothing: neither awkward cornices, nor expired words,
only city and isomnia, a preliminary sketch without colors
in order to cut ourselves off from him and not have a father.
Therefore we bit through the sketch and looked at the air.
What we looked for dead birds know:
a smell of morning over affable laughter.
Perhaps we didnt have to, we who were the lost.
But we did it, and we tried to get a rainfall to return
over the tattered farms, and to live no more,
to live without having to do it in the name of anyone.
(I speak in plural to pretend not to be so alone,
or perhaps in this night I am everyone.)
The calling of good-for-nothing words,
or living this much on your own, has small call
on you if with a daily and a deader certainty you see
that not only do you shun its laurels
but they gall you all the more greatly, so
if you honestly dont want to change your already two-bits wits
into a penny-pinching whores wholl sell her tits or soul
to any John with dough or if, fundamentally,
you do not require that much and what matters is that you bear
life and its sadness with dignity,
it would be better if, from here on in, you accept
as unavoidable the sentences of loneliness and failure,
and cling as with a bright, blind, starry-eyed abandon
to this small ridiculous calling and you make of it,
and that in your empty room the burning words
which hound you and assault you
could go cold as ashes
just for uttering your name.
Afterwards, she breathed a little, and then I thought that behind her eyes
there had always been curious lakes made of silences and ducks.
That part about the ducks —its so trite— I dont know where in the hell that came from,
but it seemed funny to me, imagining them being so congenial and clean
as they were going from the water to the sky, from the sky to the water, again,
and vice-versa, strange, very sweet children.
The breath finished, she remembered her coffee and looked at it without a sound.
Yes, we should have been unfaithful maybe.
You could have —I dont know— varied more, had more fun.
I would have learned what wasnt important to me,
and maybe everything would have been different, she said again.
This reminded me of a sad song on the radio
that was played a lot some two years ago.
With respect to the tears, I faked it better
not knowing they existed. (I never carry a handkerchief,
and according to the movies, this is what one is supposed to offer.)
Afterwards, everything ended quickly; it made me suddenly late,
and I devoted myself to performing the role from another scene right away.
Endings are never certain. They never end, she had said.
As that seemed certain to me, I felt afraid or I felt cold.
I devoted myself —as I said— to plotting another scene
that didnt smell so much of Sunday.
I should have told about false joys, absurd
and imprecise hopes, I dont really know, whatever lie.
Endings are never certain. They never end.
And I should have talked about books or ancient rains
in between jokes of lovers or children. Because endings are never certain,
they never end, but I didnt know yet how to say
that I didnt remember who loved me.
Lonely guitar, abandoned.
Earth voice, naked and loving.
Grandmother of longed for things.
Nightingale of fragrant woods.
Oh throat of lights out,
of your old and shiny strings
a cluster of tunes bloomed
in the agile hands of the girls.
Your roots of clear resonances
they remind me of childhood yards
with the moon in the white corridors.
Lonely guitar, abandoned,
if I shake your strings in mourning,
No wonder you sing or weep!
Oh yes, I will dance with her
broken and black jazz
rhythm. Europe for America.
We dance if the Ferris wheel spins,
and when the blackbirds fly up the neighbor lady's black poplar.
Because—it's the real thing—
each rite needs its chapel.
Right, Jacinta?
Oh, Jacinta, redhead, red-red-head
Rah-rah-red-reddish head.
How pretty, how pretty, oh, how pretty
they are, yes, they are, your two, two, two under the straps
of sweet lace Malinas's bone.
Oh, Jacinta,
good, greater good, supreme good.
We now have the blackbird up above,
and the little ass's Ferris wheel, spins.
Bloodless spaces, rescued
from the bleeding history,
from the happy tomorrow,
from the false time.
Bloodless spaces of the immemorial
and resuscitated flesh,
from its secret generation,
from its delicious delirium.
Bloodless spaces of spirit
—highwire walker without a wire—
of memory
and of forgetfulness.
Bloodless spaces we inhabit,
when we depart from death,
when we hold life in our arms,
when perhaps we love
or when we tell it.
The lights of dawn
clear the way for roads that cross the night,
a new day approaches and you
will have to forsake me.
Now you rest beside me,
you dream that you have stayed forever,
you smile with the tranquility
of one who has no tricks to hide,
but light is already there,
even now the sparrows are wide awake,
the fluttering wings of life are heard
and announces our taking leave.
Because you have to go away
though neither of us want it,
you will leave in me a hollow
of terrifying dimension.
because depart from this land
and this body of mine, and from these kisses,
and I don't know what will happen to you,
nor if we'll see each other ever again.
The light arrives, I tell you farewell
without awakening you, sweetly,
later I lean down to your ear
to wish you good morning.
Lord never grant me what I ask for,
The unforeseen delights me, what comes down
from your fair stars; let life
deal out before me all at once the cards
against which I must play, I want the shock
of going silently along my dark street,
feeling that I am tapped upon the shoulder,
turning about, and seeing the face of adventure.
I do not want to know where and how
I shall meet death. Caught unaware,
may my soul learn at the turn of a corner
that one step back it still lived.
The forest falls asleep and dreams,
the river does not sleep, but sings.
Among the green shadows
the ringing water flows
leaving on the dark bank
flecks of white foam.
My eyes filled with stars,
on the bottom of a boat,
I pass like an emotion
over the music of the water,
and I bear the river on my lips,
and I bear the forest in my soul.
At the game which is my life
I play with such sloth
that I shall lose the game
for not moving a pawn.
I should get up? I should go
to seek the Golden Fleece?
There is no Fleece that is worth
the weariness of the road.
As a spark sleeps in the pebble
and a statue in the clay,
so in you, divinity sleeps.
Just a press of intense pain
till the shockthe lightning of deity
bursting from the inert stone.
Therefore dont complain and blame fate,
since what is divine within you
can only emerge in such a manner.
Grin and bear it if you can,
this life the creator is sculpting,
the hard blow of the chisel.
What matter, then, the evil hours,
if every hour he adds a lovelier
plume to your nascent wings?
You shall see the condor at full altitude,
you shall see the completed sculpture,
you shall see, my soul, you shall see...
Artifex vitae, artifex sui
Very near to my sunset now, I bless you, life,
because you never gave me any false hope
or unjust labor or unwarranted punishment;
because at the end of my rough road, I see
that I was the architect of my own fate,
that if I extracted honey or gall from things
it was because I instilled them with a gall or honey flavor:
when I planted rosebushes, I always harvested roses.
True, after all my blossoms, winter must come—
but you never said that May would last forever!
Certainly I had my long nights with the blues,
but you never promised only good nights,
and to make up for it, I had some that were holy and serene.
I loved, I was loved, the sun caressed my face.
Life, you owe me nothing! Life, we are at peace!
And why shouldn't it be true that there's a soul?
What labor does it cost God, who fibrils
the phosphorescent tulle of the nebulae,
who veins brushstrokes so subtle
of light on the comets that never fail,
to give immortality to the spirit?
Is it more incomprehensible, by chance,
to be reborn than to be born? Is it more absurd
to go on living than to have lived,
to be unwitnessed and exist, as around
us here throb and exist
numberless forms that science
surprises every instant
with its lynx eyes?
Hope, our commonplace bread;
hope, nurse of the wretched;
murmur to me those intimate words
that in silent night feign,
in the inmost obscurity of my mind,
whispers of white seraphim...
Isn't it true that I will encounter my dead?
If you know, why do you not inform?
Because I still wonder at radiant dawns
and there are roses, many roses, many roses
in them that tremble the shine of Bethel
and there are roses, many roses, many roses,
thank you, all is well!
Because faintly, late in the day,
piously kisses the sun my temple,
and transfigures me soon with his ray:
Because at night a voice calls me
(a voice of one I know), and there's a dell
found in my shadow in its seam:
Because even the bad in my gift is of heaven,
and it quakes, anon!, with ardent might,
disconceiving the walls of my cell;
because surrounds me now my first flight:
Each perfect rose that unfolded yesterday,
each sunrise I note between blushes,
fills me with deep pleasure...
I never tire of seeing with my own eyes
the perpetual miracle of life.
Long ago, I looked at the stars
in the transparent nights of Spain,
finding them more exquisite each time.
Long ago, by the sea, alone,
I heard the waves quarrelling,
and the waves' wonder stuns me.
Each time I find nature
more supernatural, more pure and holy.
For me, here, everything is beautiful
and everything enchants me equally:
the mouth of the mother, praying,
the mouth of the child, singing.
I want passionately to be immortal,
because it is marvelous, the panorama
that invites us to immense creation;
because every star calls to me,
saying with brilliant light, "here, also,
they think, here they struggle, here they love."
You who assume I don't believe
whenever we two debate:
you can't imagine how I long,
I thirst, I hunger for God.
You've never heard
my desperate cries filling
the heart of darkness
with invocations of the Infinite.
You've never seen how my thought,
in its dedication to bearing
the ideal, regularly endures
the tortures of childbirth.
If my barren spirit
had your fertility,
it would've already forged a heaven
to make its world whole.
But I say: who knows
what effort would suffice
in a soul with no flag
to lead your torturer about,
a soul that lives by abstinence from faith,
and with heroic tenacity,
interrogates each abyss
and each night, asking why?
At all events, I take refuge
in my thirst for investigation,
my craving for God, deep and silent;
and there is more love in my doubt
than in your heated contention.
She kissed me often, as if she feared
an imminent departure... Her affections
were restless, nervous.
I didn't understand
such feverish haste. My coarse intention
never saw very far...
She foresaw!
She foresaw that our time would be short,
that the sail battered by the winds lash
was already waiting... and in her anxiety
she tried to leave me her soul with every embrace,
to put all eternity into her kisses.
"Now there is no human pain that will be my pain;
now neither eyes weep, nor soul anguishes
lest I anguish and weep;
now my heart is the lamp steadfast through all vigils,
oh Christ!
"In vain I search in the deep recesses of my being
to find some hate: no one can pierce me now
but with piety and love. All are I, I am all,
oh Cristo!
"What matters bads or goods! For me all are goods.
The rose bush has no thorns: for me it yields but roses.
Roses of Passion? What matters! Roses of celestial essence,
purple as the blood that you spilled for us,
oh Christ!"
That evening in the poplar grove, mad
with love, the sweet one I idolized
offered me the wild rose of her mouth.
And the basalt Buddha smiled
Later there was another whose charms
captured me; we made a date, and in the shade
exchanged letters and lockets.
And the basalt Buddha smiled...
Its been a year today since I lost her love.
I return to our trysting spot and, exhausted
from the long walk, creep up to the top
of the pedestal where the image rests.
The day dies, squandered and bloody,
and in the arms of the basalt Buddha
I'm astonished to see the mysterious moon.
The day you shall love me will bear more light than June,
The night you shall love me full-mooned,
a tale left untold within each ray,
The day you shall love me will bear more roses than May
The day you shall love me, waterfalls will shine,
gushing along the hillsides, crystalline
The day you shall love me, shy thickets will echo,
hushed harmonies a myriad of arpeggios,
and your eyes, ablaze with springtime glee,
will shine with grateful ecstasy,
for all the things that have been and shall be,
Oh, the day you shall love me!
The day you shall love me, the hills -abloom,
shall scatter my love with their sweet perfume.
The day you shall love me,  a plenitude of daisies
stretched out along meadows and prairies,
shall bow before you in gentle reverence
singing out gaily their pure innocence
The day you shall love me, burthened clovers shall lift their gaze,
to brighter skies and brighter days
and at the first blush of dawn,
amidst the idle ponds, their petals drawn
shall flourish lotuses, in all their majesty,
Oh the day you shall love me
The day you shall love me,my love shall shake the heaven on high,
painting red, the impassioned sky.
And after the natural world has sung its praise,
through lyres or other lavish displays,
we shall seal with a kiss this celestial beauty,
My only love and so wholly mine
Making desirable my days,
How well we both know what absence is
Since the flesh hinders us so always!
My hands to be sure have forgotten you
But my eyes can see you as I tell,
Whenever the world grows bitter for me
I shut them both then I see you well.
I never want to meet you again
Who are with me always, I do not care
How I shatter to pieces life which is yours
Which for me weaves this dream so fair.
Just as one day you said to me
that it is your living image I own,
Because daily I wash my eyes
With the tears wherein your memory shone.
One went away but it was not you,
My love whom the silences can claim,
If my two arms even and my mouth
Went away with the words the name.
This is not I, the other it is
Silent as usual but lasting for aye,
Just like this love so wholly mine
Which will go on with me till I die.
Come
Beloved
I will savor you with joy.
You will dream of me tonight.
Your body will end
where the hour of your fertility and agony
begins for me;
and because we exist full of anguish
my love for you is born within your breast,
I love you, to begin with, for your mouth..
We shall dine at the site of my soul.
Before I open myself, I will open my body for you
like the full and uprooted sea
until the twilight of fish.
Because you are beautiful,
my brother,
my eternal sweetness,
Your waist in which the day flickers
filling all things with its scent,
Your decision to love,
suddenly,
pours unexpectedly into my soul.
Your morning sex
where the worlds edge rests
then lengthens.
Your voice will be a bouquet of light at my feet.
We will speak of your body
with the purest joy,
like sleepless children at whose side
another child went barely discovered,
and revealed at his incipient arrival,
his future age known completely, without measure
in his approaching genital torrent,
endless riverbed, in tightened solitude.
You will dream of me tonight,
and our mouths will seal the fallen scents.
I will inhabit you with larks and weeks
eternally dark and naked.
Do you remember, Louis Armstrong,
the day we traveled through a corridor of sound
that we loved until death?
Remember the onomatopeya we couldn't create
that gave us a throne in one blow?
It seems unreal, Louis, my love,
that we have shared so much,
so many branches
and such a great number of spumes.
It seems impossible, Louis,
that the blue forms which accompanied us
now dissolve between us;
and you, arrow, arm of the living angel,
venture where no one can recognize you save by your joy,
by your peach tree voice,
by your way of prolonging yourself in the light
and swelling in air.
I don't believe the multitude of brilliance that once pursued us
has disappeared from the world.
Rather I believe it is hidden in time
and it will not be consumed.
You, incessant fire,
pedestal of cloud,
butterfly ending,
today you walk adrift amid flour
and amid other incorruptible matter that protects you
as it safekeeps all the just,
all the beautiful ones
whose beauty comes from afar and never departs,
and is illuminated each day
like the heights.
Satchmo, loved as far as music,
dreamed as far as an arpeggio,
the harps of David and their weight of copper
touch your soul
and the harpsichord of your endless hair.
Richard Wagner is standing, waiting for you on a tetralogical roof,
full of flowers that walk and grow incessantly
Richard Wagner himself
sees you arrive at the realm of crystals,
armed with a bastard and a bass trumpet
playing a wind son ,
sounding like a thunderclap
newly born humid and perfect.
And I, sonorous shadow of the future,
I also am there,
dreamed by two transparent bodies
that kiss and fuse and blur
on the great tetralogical roof 
where all is clear as God
and love
and the trees.
Small bell
bell so little
The moon lays down a pillow
for the greyhound to sleep
Great bell
tower of bells
the night steals a long robe
to dress itself in day
violin
violincello,
the sun leaves his handkerchief
and carries his little spear
little bell
tolling bell,
the bird-full of song-
drinks the dawn.
My most beautiful hiding places,
places that best fit my souls deepest colors,
are made of all that others forgot.
They are solitary sites hollowed out in the grasss caress,
in a shadow of wings, in a passing song;
regions whose limits swirl with the ghostly carriages
that transport the mist in the dawn,
and in whose skies names are sketched, ancient words of love,
vows burning like constellations of drunken fireflies.
Sometimes earthly villages pass, hoarse trains make camp,
a couple piles marvelous oranges at the edge of the sea,
a single relic is spread through all space.
My places would look like broken mirages,
clippings of photographs torn from an album to orient nostalgia,
but they have roots deeper than this sinking ground,
these fleeing doors, these vanishing walls.
They are enchanted islands where only I can be the magician.
And who else, if not I, is climbing the stairs towards those attics in the clouds
where the light, aflame, used to hum in the siestas honey,
who else will open again the big chest where the remains of an unhappy story lie,
sacrificed a thousand times only to fantasy, only to foam,
and try on the rags again
like those costumes of invincible heroes,
circle of fire that inflamed times scorpion?
Who cleans the windowpane with her breath and stirs the fire of the afternoon
in those rooms where the table was an altar of idolatry,
each chair, a landscape folded up after every trip,
and the bed, a stormy short cut to the other shore of dreams,
rooms deep as nets hung from the sky,
like endless embraces I slid down till I brushed the feathers of death,
until I overturned the laws of knowledge and the fall of man?
Who goes into the parks with the golden breath of each Christmas
and washes the foliage with a little gray rag that was the handkerchief for waving goodbye,
and reweaves the garlands with a thread of tears,
repeating a fantastic ritual among smashed wine glasses and guests lost in thought,
while she savors the twelve green grapes of redemption—
one for each month, one for each year, one for each century of empty indulgence—
a taste acid but not as sharp as the bread of forgetfulness?
Because who but I changes the water for all the memories?
Who inserts the present like a slash into the dreams of the past?
Who switches my ancient lamps for new ones?
My most beautiful hiding places are solitary sites where no one goes,
and where there are shadows that only come to life when I am the
magician.
And dont you feel also, perhaps, a stormy sorrow on the skin of time,
like a scar that opens again
there where the sky was uprooted?
And dont you feel sometimes how that night gathers its tatters into an ominous bird,
that theres a beating of wings against the roof
like a clash among immense spring leaves struggling
or of hands clapping to summon you to death?
And dont you feel afterwards someone exiled is crying,
that theres an ember of a fallen angel on the threshold,
brought suddenly like a beggar by an alien gust of wind?
And dont you feel, like me, that a house rolling toward the abyss
runs over you with a crash of crockery shattered by lightning,
with two empty shells embracing each other for an endless journey,
with a screech of axles suddenly fractured like loves broken promises?
And dont you feel then your bed sinking like the nave of a cathedral crushed by the fall of heaven,
and that a thick, heavy water runs over your face till the final judgment?
Again its the slime.
Again your heart thrown into the depth of the pool,
prisoner once more among the waves closing a dream.
Lie down as I do in this miserable eternity of one day.
Its useless to howl.
From these waters the beasts of oblivion dont drink.
I Advise you to sleep when you can't
to go to mass in a dream
to pay all your debts on horseback
to knock on a door and have it be opened
to play with a typewriter on the floor of your room
If the drugs for your insomnia can't get you to sleep
go out on your balcony at midnight
and watch the soldiers coming home from the war
or a woman carrying a flower pot
or four penitents from Seville
I warn you that it's the same
whether you sleep or not
whether you dream or smoke
if when you light a match
you burn the darkness
and the flame speaks to you
Tell your pillow that you are a lord
a lord a lord
don't let it think
you forgot how to sleep as it well knows.
Here you have, through and through, the man
who loved, lived, died inwardly
and one fine day went out to the street: then
he understood: and he tore up all his poems.
Thats how it is, and was. He went out
one night frothing at the eyes, drunk
with love, fleeing, he knew not where:
to where the air did not stink of death.
Tents of peace, swaying pavilions,
were his arms, like a flame in the wind;
waves of blood flooding his breast, huge
waves of visible hate washing over all his body.
Here! Approach! But oh! Atrocious angels
cross the sky in horizontal flight;
horrible metallic fishes traverse
the seas spine, from port to port.
I bequeath all my poems for one
man at peace. Here, in flesh and blood, you have
my last will and testament. Bilbao, the eleventh
of April, nineteen and fifty-one.
Blas de Otero
You, poetry,
shadow more mystery
than the dark roots of the old trees,
more than the hidden air
that the secret veins of the profound minerals,
the farthest brightest star
the hidden burning in the center of the soil.
You, mixed music
the soft sounding harp of the constellations,
You, ascending music
the edge of the ultimate blue cliff,
You, music of yours
the tam-tam of pulses and the song of the blood.
You, poetry
born for the man and his language,
no white seagulls are over a shipless sea
no pretty flowers standing tall over a scar of the desert.
When nothing remains of me but a tree,
when my bones have been scattered
beneath our mother earth:
when nothing remains of you but a white rose
nourished by that which once you were:
when the breath of the kiss that we exchange today
has embarked upon a thousand different breezes:
when even our names have become
mere sounds without echo
asleep In the shade of a fathomless sound:
then you will live on in the beauty of the rose,
and I in the rustling of the tree,
and our love in the murmur of the breeze.
Listen to me!
My wish for us is, to live
in the spoken words of men.
I would survive with you
in the deep lifestream of humanity:
in the laughter of children,
in the peace of mankind,
in love without weeping.
Therefore,
as we must give ourselves to the rose and the tree,
to the earth and the wind,
let us give ourselves, I beg you, to the future of the world.
Oft the confession of my changeless love
Your close-drawn lattice in the night must hear:
The moon, befriending hearts bereft of cheer,
Knows well my longing as she gleams above:
Your name is cooed to me by that wild dove
Whose haunts I visit when the eve is near:
At morn my madrigals glad-voiced and clear
Fill with their ecstasy the hill and grove.
To you alone my secret reaches never,
Howe'er my heartbeat strives to tell the tale
Unbidden, ardent in a dear endeavor.
Perchance for all time shall its message fail,
As falls unheard where Ocean throbs forever
The rill's faint call that tinkles down the vale.
Reading her verses
Jasmine cathedral erected in the breeze,
your snowing petals perfume the world.
Oh house of the wave's foam and the smile,
for the dream, the cloud, the song!
The word, imbued with your essence,
drinks dawn's radiance till drunk;
and in your being's weightless flow
grace is a talent, generosity a calling.
Jasmine grove that time turns into spring...
form of this poetry, so light,
that just in giving us its scent its petals fall.
But in the rhythm that its voice assumes,
everything is dream and music and perfume
because as it passes the world turns into flower.
Black men dance, dance, dance
round the roaring flames,
Tum-cutum, tum-cutum,
round the roaring flames.
Under coconuts, before ocean waves,
ferocious, lascivious teeth,
bodies coated with mud and molasses,
armpit smells, dangling breasts,
and coal-glazed eyes
the deep gongo ignites.
Black men dance at night
Tum-cutum, turn cu-tum,
Who is the bravest chief?
Which the loveliest maiden?
Where sleeps the meanest croc?
What spell killed Babissa?
in the island's solitude.
The moon is a silver tortoise
swimming in placid night.
Who'll be the fearless fisher
to bring it trapped in his net:
Sokola, Babiro, Bombassa,
Yombofre, Bulon or Babissa?
Look, the moon, the silver fish,
the old evil tortoise
pissing into the night's water
its sedating, enchanting juice...
Catch the moon, catch the moon,
bring it dangling on a hook.
In full-moon night, in this night's
brightly polished moon,
like a dark frog, my heart
leaps onto the grass.
How happy my heart feels right now!
How joyfully it lifts its head
musing in he moonlight,
this shy, tragedian frog!
High in the branches,
gentle birds are dreaming,
and higher, beyond clouds,
just-washed gleam the stars...
Ah, let morning never come!
Never end, drowsy hour,
in whose bliss things assume
a supreme dream-reality;
when my heart like a frog
emerges from its swamp
and takes off in moonlight
on a star's flight among the stars!

The boss man says: tu-cu-tú
The boss lady says:  to-co-tó
Its the sun of irons that burns in Timbuktu (Mali)
Its the black dance of Fernando Póo.

The stuffed-shirted toad in the pool dreams: cro-cro-cró

Cane and jail
Beat those that gather in furious ú (ultimar  final, to kill, ultraje  outrage)
The gongs vibrate with profound ó
Its the Black race that, undulating,

The big bosses gather at the party already.
Dance what youll dance, the black he gives.
Jail and Cane.
Cane and Jail.
The boss man says: tu-cu-tú.
The boss lady says: to-co-tó.
They pass the red lands, isles of tar.
Haiti, Martinique, Congo, Cameroon;
The Papiamento-speaking Antilles of rum
And the Patois-speaking Isles of the volcano
How burdened they are
with the song they give.
The African soul is vibrating
In the fat rhythm of Mariyandá.
The big boss says: tu-cu-tú
The lady boss says: to-co-tó.
All today I thought of the distant sorrow
my flesh must feel, away in its remote houses
and slums damned to darkness,
their shadow world of packed instincts.
At times from its roaring, hidden high seas,
those uncharted leagues, arrive echoes
so faint they die like waves too weak to crest
on a beach congealed in fog and silence.
They are calls that franticly flee
the unknown depths of these secret dramas:
cries for help, screams for aid, groans
as if a colossal ship were wrecked far off.
Oh those limbos submerged in trapped night,
those unimagined inner horizons extending
underground inside us,
beyond the mind's radius of light!
Maybe the saddest interior tragedies,
the most heartbreaking events
take place in those mute shadow slums
as we hear not the faintest moan,
and maybe when we laugh till we cry,
we are the bleak, grotesque setting
of that monstrous, inconsolable sorrow,
whose useless voice is lost in the wind.
A foil-thrust of light,
yellow light, red light.
In the fight, a shot
of radiant feathers.
Energy decked out
from crest to tail
amber, gold, velvet
opulence that molts
heroicaly  (sic) silent
in shout-filled arenas.
Luminous wheel traced
round the clucking hen,
open his plume cape
cloakingly stretched
Rooster, cock of the tropics.
Beak distillery of dawns.
Congealed lightning bolt.
Dazzling palatte (sic).
Plumed rum to quench
the sweltering Island defiant!
My soul is like a well of deaf, deep water
on whose solemn, unrippled peace
days wheel, drowning their daily murmur
in the calm that curdles in barren hollows.
Below, the water lays its agony brightness,
a feeble iridescence fermenting in darkness,
lymphs that clot into long black slime
and exude this bloodless blue phosphorescence.
My soul is like a well. The sleepy water landscape
trembling composes itself and disperses,
while below, fathoms, perhaps a thousand years back
dreams a crouched, misanthropic frog.
At times under the moons long influence,
the well displays the misty magic of a fable:
a frogs deep croaking echoes in its water,
and it brims with a faint sense of eternity.
O my fine, my honeycoloured Duke of Marmalade!
Where are your alligators in the far-off camp on the Pongo,
And the round blue shadow of your African baobabs,
And your fifteen wives smelling of the forest and the mud?
No longer will you eat the succulent roast child,
Nor will the tame monkey at siesta time kill your lice,
Nor your gentle eye follow the tracks of the effeminate giraffe.
Across the fiat hot silence of the plain.
Gone are your nights with their flowing bonfire hair
And their somnolent everlasting dripping of drums,
Into whose depths you would sink slowly as into warm mud
Till you reached the ultimate shores of your great greatgrandfather.
Now, in the showy frame of your French dress-coat,
You pass sugared with greetings like any courtier,
In spite of your feet, which from their ducal boots
Cry out to you: Babilongo, climb up by the palace cornices.
How elegantly goes my Duke with Madame Coffeewith,
All velvety and dainty in the violins' blue wave,
Restraining the hands that from their patrician gloves
Cry out to him: Babilongo, knock her down on that rose sofa!
From the ultimate shores of your great greatgrandfather,
Across the flat hot silence of the plain,
Why do your crocodiles weep in the far-off camp on the Pongo,
O my fine, my honeycoloured Duke of Marmalade?
The little Count of Lemonade,
Playful, tiny... A monkeyshine
Wandering, tiny and playful,
Through the salons of Christophe the Great.
His gay little monkey face
To everyone says; "Yes.
Yes, Madame Coffeewith, Monsieur Haiti,
That way, this way".
While the macaque patricians
Pass by, armed with squat cocoanuts,
Solemnly black with nobility,
The Count, tiny and playful,
Is a flowing delicacy
That fills the salon with niceties...
"Yes, Madame Coflfeewith, Monsieur Haiti,
See him in the rigadoon.
Watch him in the minuet...
No one in the Court of Christophe the Great
Wears the brocade coat with so much grace
Or moves on such a genteel foot.
His social formula is: oh, pardon!
His word of elegance: volupté!
Ah, but in the presence of His Highness
You must never dare say: Look out for the snake!
Because, losing his head in an instant,
All the fine aristocrat vanishes!
And there goes the Count of Lemonade
With his red brocade coat in a whirl
And his proud jaw
Rigid in epileptic tension...
There he goes with grotesque gestures
Multiplying orang-utans
In the mirrors of Christophe the Great.
Down the scorching Antillean street
Goes Tembandumba of the Quimbamba
Between two rows of black faces
—Rumba, macumba, candombe, bámbula.
Before her, a congo band thumps
A bombastic congagongos and maracas.
Steatopygously the Queen steps up
And her immense buttocks with drums collide
So that seductive wiggles slide
In curdled rivers of sugar and molasses.
Brown-skinned mill of sweet sensation,
Her colossal hips, those massive mortars,
Make rhythms ooze, sweat bleed like blood,
And all this grinding ends in dance.
Goes Tembandumba of the Quimbamba.
Flower of Tórtola, Rose of Uganda,
For you the bombas and bambulas crackle.
For you these feverish nights go wild
And set on fire Antillas ñáñiga blood.
Haiti offers you its gourds;
Jamaica pours its fiery rums;
Cuba tells you, give us what you got, mulata!
And Puerto Rico: melao, melamba!
Get down, my black-faced love-crazed rascals.
Jangle, drums, and jiggle, maracas.
—Rumba, macamba, candombe, bámbula.
Pity, Lord, pity on my poor town
where my poor people will likely die of nothing.
That old notary who devotes his days
to his slow, detailed, rat's worries;
this fat mayor, huge his vacuous paunch,
dabbling in his life as if in a sauce;
that store with few customers, unchanged for ten centuries;
those goats frisking in the plaza sun,
a beggar, a bony horse, scabby and gray,
clomping along these wide streets;
the cold, grinding boredom of Sundays
shooting pool and playing cards in bars;
Everything, the whole tedious herd of these lives
in this old town where nothing happens,
all this dies, falls, collapses
from living easy and content with one's lot.
Pity, Lord, pity on my poor town.
Over these simple souls, unleash some rogue
who'd hurl against their dead-water lives
the liberating stone of an impulsive act...
Some thief to break open that Bank in the night,
some Don Juan to seduce that chaste young lady,
some professional cardshark to enter the town
and shuffle these honorable, docile people.
where my poor people will likely die of nothing.
Granada and LeÃ³n, cities
sisters, in the flaws
of the same qualities.
They talk a lot about projects,
for a dreamed future
that is announced and never arrives.
And the present turns dark
under the blind gloom
of politics: plague,
leprosy, curse, poison.
North, south, east and west
our country once full
has fallen into the horror
of emptiness: Liberal,
was it you? Conservative,
is it your fault? Which.
.....
Well, holding hands
let's go down the road
of men, as brothers,
who drink the same wine,
they start from the same bread,
within the same house,
while satan outside
enemy, passes and passes.
Soft as the danger just a day
with impossible to reach the fragile midnight
and your hand worth mine, and many lives
almost silent lips said what was thought.
A night spent you pasted as a tree of life
because  you were soft as the danger,
as the danger of living again.
I saw four women struggling to the breast of a dead man,
I saw four women struggling alone, later,
possesion of the puff
and disputing with its fierce nails by Abel Garmin happy that
gives up those bones
There are four women who stole my stench sensitive
my rot in the body that still breathe slow-mind letting it
leave from there my soul like a fart.
And those four beings now keep the bloody rest of my spirit
and dwell forever in the carnage of its every day low mouths
and of the nest of their buttocks
to know whole in the insensitive of the time
as it was the sense that I learned not from the sky
as it falls below the word never.
As an old man sucking a dry lemon 
so is the poetic Act.
The horse with his sword
split life in two:
a one side pleasure without nothing
and other, as defeated female
the life that bad odor.
Nothing from you at all. Your being seems
a cloistered garden where, in the afternoon,
an infinite presence is a haunting guest,
deep in the moment's utter silences.
The leaves tremble. They and the crazy wind
flee through the garden where the spirit rests
like an affliction, hidden and accursed,
fastened for ever in the sobbing shade.
And now and then the slanting western sun
velvets the blue majestic cypresses
over whose crest a wing hangs motionless,
all outcry null and muffled in the mist;
and bitterness flows toward oblivion
upon the peace of the tremendous heart.
Since man's life is nothing but a bit of action at a distance,
A bit of foam shining inside a glass;
Since trees are nothing but moving trees;
Nothing but chairs and tables in perpetual motion;
Since we ourselves are nothing but beings
(As the godhead itself is nothing but God);
Now that we do not speak solely to be heard
But so that others may speak
And the echo precede the voice that produces it;
Since we do not even have the consolation of a chaos
In the garden that yawns and fills with air,
A puzzle that we must solve before our death
So that we may nonchalantly resuscitate later on
When we have led woman to excess;
Since there is also a heaven in hell,
Permit me to propose a few things:
I wish to make a noise with my feet
I want my soul to find its proper body.
that they get it over with once and for all
I'm giving the solar system the slip
everything back into the womb
I'm saying it's over finished and done with
nobody's escaping
everything over with in one stroke
why beat around the bush
great thing the Vietnam War
great thing the Prostate Operation
I Jehovah decree old age
you people make me laugh
you people give me the creeps
only a born moron
could get down on his knees and worship a statue
frankly I don't know what to tell you
we're on the brink of the Third World War
and nobody seems to have noticed
if you destroy the world
do you think I'm going to create it over again?
To Salvador Novo
Tropics, why did you give me
these hands brimming with color?
Whatever I touch
brims over with sunlight.
Ill pass through the delicate afternoons of other lands
with the sound of a glass sunflower.
Let me for one moment
stop being all noise and color.
change the climate of my heart,
soak up the half-light of some solitary thing,
lean out from a distant balcony in silence,
sink deep into the fine folds of my cloak,
be strewn upon the bank of a quiet passion,
softly caress the long straight hair
and write my reflections out with a fine pencil.
Oh, for one moment not to be
Field adjutant to the sun!
these hands brimming with color!
to Pedro HenrÃ­quez UreÃ±a
I shall play with the houses of CuraÃ§ao,
I shall put the sea on the left
and make more bridges that sway.
So says the poet!
We are in Holland and America too,
and this is a toyshop isle,
where the laws are a queen's
and doors and windows smile.
With the strings of the lyre
and the handkerchiefs of the voyage,
we shall make sails for boats
that never go anywhere.
Government House is far too small
for a Dutch family.
This evening Claude Monet will arrive
to eat blue and electric things.
And up this suspicious alley
we shall send Rembrandt's Night Watch.
...give me the port of CuraÃ§ao!
toyshop isle,
When all the ants have come out of the clock
and the door to solitude opens at last,
death
will no longer find me.
She will look for me among trees driven mad
by the silence of one thing beyond another.
She will not find me on the raveled plateau
sensing her at the source of a rose.
I am slicing the fruit of insomnia
with a hand accidentally slashed.
And my house is open and undefended,
for death will no longer find me.
And she will have to seek me above trees and among clouds.
(Voice kindling fruit and color!)
And I cannot wait for her: I have a date
with life, at the windows of a song.
I hear steps — very far away?...
Theres still time to escape.
For the night to raise its stars,
a deep sound of shadows fell onto the sea.
And the blood explodes against my heart.
The falling dusk is so bright that I can undress.
Then when death comes to seek me,
she will find only my clothing.
You are more than my sight for you see
what I bear of your life in my eyes.
And so I walk blind to myself
illumined by my eyes that burn
with the fire of you.
You are more than my hearing for you hear
what I bear of your voice in my ears.
And so I walk deaf to myself
full of your tender inflections.
Your voice alone!
You are more than my scent for you smell
what my nostrils bear of your odor.
And so I go in ignorance of my own aroma,
exuding your perfumed precincts,
a sudden garden of you!
You are more than my tongue for you taste
what I bear on my tongue of you alone,
and so I go insensible to my flavors
tasting the delight of yours,
the taste only of you.
You are more than my touch for on me
you caress your caress and spill over.
And so I touch on my body the pleasure
of your hands set afire by mine.
And I am only the living mirror
of your senses. The faithfulness
of the lake in the volcanos throat.
Long live Spain!
Lift your faces,
Sons of the Spanish People
For you will rise again
Glory to the Fatherland
that knew how to follow
over the blue of the sea
the path of the sun.
Spain triumphs
anvils and wheels
sing to the rhythm
of the hymn of the faith.
Together with them
let's stand and sing
the new and powerful life
of labour and peace.
Politics is useful for many things
In contrast to the muses
who sometimes are there to shame us.
Gambler, who with a wandering step
you rush to the harm,
attend to this disappointment,
and to this constant experience,
if you want to win triumphantly
the star of your destiny.
When to this pilgrim sea
from the vice longing you go,
enter through this and you will see
how you hit the road.
He was a luckless devil who used to come
Around the big town where I had my home;
Young, reddish, weakly, dirty and ill clad,
Forever shamefaced... Another gone to the bad!
One winter day some hunters found him dead
In a little creek that near my garden led,
As, singing, with their hounds they tramped along...
The papers that he had they searched among,
But nothing found... The local judges made
Inquiry of the night watchman, but he said
That he knew not a thing of the deceased;
And PÃ©rez and Pinto, neigbors, not the least.
A young girl said he might have been insane,
Some wandering wastrel seeking food in vain;
A man who heard their chatter saw a joke
And tried to laugh... Well, they were simple folk!
Over the dead man's corpse the sexton let
A few clods fall; then rolled a cigarette,
Pulled down his broad-brimmed hat, and went his way...
After the clods, no one had aught to say!...
A light and drizzling rain descends
And softly falls upon the plains;
And with it comes the pang that rends;
It rains...
And, since alone in the spacious room
Sick and in bed I vigil keep,
To daunt the fears that round me loom
I sleep.
But near me still the steady shower
Its light but weary drip maintains;
I waken up; for fright I cower;
Then, dead with terror that appals,
Before the vast expanse I shrink,
And, while the weary water falls,
I think.
Here the springtime comes again,—
Wake the bagpipe—dance around—
Spreading o'er the hill and plain
Her green mantle—Hope is found!
There is sighing of the breeze,—
And the cloud that swiftly flees
Shows the blue vault—Hope is found!
From its blossom laughs the flower,—
And the murmur of its power
Shows the streamlet—Hope is found!
Blue-birds' trill is on the air,—
Open to the swallow, there
He comes winging—Hope is found!
Sweetheart, little sweetheart mine,—
May is stealing through the vine,
With her promise—Hope is found!
Love is over all the land—
To its breath our hearts expand,
Where it rises—Hope is found!
All the world is budding green,—
And the budding leaves between,
Crops are growing—Hope is found!
Murmur, odor, color grow—
Into hymns of love to show
What is stirring—Hope is found!
Soon the lightsome spring will die,—
Every year the meadows nigh
Change her mantle—Hope is found!
Dear old days of innocence—
Hush the bagpipe—dance no more—
Lost, they never re-commence,—
Lost are mine—and Hope is o'er!—
night, slipping away
give me your hand
work of the bustling angel
days commit suicide
why?
good night
You who sing all my deaths.
You who sing what you dont trust
to the dream of time,
describe the house of emptiness to me,
tell me about those words dressed in coffins
that inhabit my innocence.
With all of my deaths
I surrender to my death,
with fistfuls of childhood,
with drunk desires,
that didnt walk under the sun,
and theres no early-rising word
that gives death reason,
and there isnt a god for dying without a grimace.
The winds light between the pines: do I comprehend these signs of incandescent sadness?
A hanged man swings from the tree marked by the lilac cross.
Until he managed to slide out of my dream and enter my room, through the window, in complicity with the midnight wind.
Someone tried to open some door. Her hands ache, gripping a prison of ill-omened bones.
All night shes struggled with her new shadow. It rained inside dawn and mourners wailed incessantly.
Childhood implores from my nights in the crypt.
Music emits ingenuous colors.
Gray birds at dawn are to the closed window what my poem is to my misfortunes.
The forces of language are solitary, devastated ladies, who sing through my voice I hear in the distance. And far away, in the black sand, lies a dense daughter of ancestral music. 
Where the true death? I have wanted to illuminate myself in the light of my lack of light. Branches die in memory. The reclined girl dwells within me, wearing her wolf mask. 
She who couldnt anymore and implored flames and we burned.
When the roof flies off the house of language and words dont offer shelter, I speak.
The ladies in red lost themselves in their masks even though theyll come back to sob among flowers.
Death is not mute. I listen to the song of the mourners seal the cracks of silence. I listen to your sweetest weeping blooming in my gray
Death has returned its enchanting prestige to silence. And I wont say my poem and I must say it. Even if the poem (here, now) doesnt make sense, it has no destiny.
Theyve come.
They invade the blood.
They smell like feathers,
like scarcity,
like weeping.
But you nourish fear
and solitude
like two small animals
lost in the desert.
Theyve come
to ignite the age of dreaming.
Your life is a goodbye.
But you embrace yourself
like a serpent mad with movement
that only finds herself
because theres no one there.
You cry beneath your sobs
you open the little chest of your desires
and youre richer than the night.
But its so lonely outside
that words kill themselves.
Night messengers announce the unheard.
It was searched for beneath the howl of light.
There was resistance against the advance of the gloved hands
that strangled innocence.
And if they hid in the house of my blood,
how not to drag myself to my lover
who dies behind my tenderness?
Why dont I flee
and chase myself with knives
babbling deliriously?
Every instant is woven from death.
I devour fury like a foolish angel
invaded by weeds
that disrupt the memory of the color of the sky.
But they and I both know
that the sky is the color of a dead childhood.
life plays in the plaza
with the person I never was
and here I am
thought dances
on the cord of my smile
and everyone says it happened and it is
its passing by
my heart
opens the window
life
here I am
my life
my lone, paralyzed blood
rings out in the world
but I want to know myself alive
but I dont want to talk
about death
or about her strange hands
this gloomy delusion of living
this hidden whim of living
it drags you along alejandra dont deny it.
today you looked at yourself in the mirror
and it left you sad and alone
the light roared the air sang
but your lover didnt come back
youll send messages youll smile
youll flutter your hands so that
your lover so loved will come back
you hear the demented siren that stole him
the ship with seafoam beards
where laughter died
you remember that last embrace
oh, no anguish at all
laugh in the handkerchief cry wild laughs
but close the doors of your face
so later they cant say
that woman in love was you
days distress you
nights accuse you
life hurts so much so much
desperate one, what for?
desperate one, no more!
Its sunny outside.
Its no more than a sun
but the men watch it
and then sing.
I dont know the sun.
I know the melody of an angel
and the last winds
warm sermon.
I know how to wail until dawn,
when death poses naked
in my shadow.
I weep beneath my name.
I wave handkerchiefs in the night
and ships thirsty for reality
dance with me.
I conceal nails
to mock my sick dreams.
I dress myself in ashes.
to recognize my emblem in thirst
to signify the only dream
to never again sustain myself with love
Ive been nothing but an offering
all of me the wandering
of a she-wolf in the forest
in the night of the bodies
to speak the innocent word
From the other side of night
her name awaits
her surreptitious yearning to live,
from the other side of night!
Something cries in the air,
sounds design the dawn.
She thinks about eternity.
The name he called me lost,
his face circles around me
like the sound of water at night,
of water falling into water.
And his smile is the last survivor,
not my memory.
The most beautiful
in the night of those who leave,
oh beloved,
is your endless unreturn
you, shadow until the day of days.
The island runs away
And the girl once again climbs the wind
and discovers the death of the prophetic bird
its suppressed fire
its flesh
a leaf
a stone
lost in the fountain of torment
like the sailor in the horror of civilization
that purifies nightfall
the girl discovers the mask of the infinite
and breaks the wall of poetry
I already know truth
it erupts in my desires
and in my disasters
in my discrepancies
in my disturbances
in my delusions
now
to seek life
Ambushed in my writing
you are singing in my poem.
Captive of your sweet voice
engraved in my memory.
Bird intent on its flight.
Air branded by absence.
Clock that keeps time with me
so I never wake up.
my wings?
two rotten petals
my reasoning?
small cups of bitter wine
my life?
a well-planned void
my body?
a gash on the chair
my moodiness?
a childish gong
my silhouette?
a concealed zero
my eyes?
ah! slices of the infinite
at this innocent hour
I sat together with the one I was
on the threshold of my gaze
animal heaved to its furthest tracks
or naked girl sitting in the forgotten
while her cracked skull wanders sobbing
in search of a purer body
she undresses in the paradise
of her memory
she cant recognize the fierce destiny
of her visions
shes scared of not being able to name
what doesnt exist
These are the versions proposed to us:
a hole, a trembling wall.
These bones shining at night,
these words like precious stones,
in the living throat of a petrified bird,
this green so beloved,
this warm lilac
this uniquely mysterious heart.
explaining with words of this world
that a ship set sail from me with me on board
Ive leapt from myself into dawn.
Ive left my body next to the light
and sung the sadness of what is born.
the castaways behind the shadow
embraced the one who killed herself
with the silence of her blood
the night drank wine
and danced naked among the fogs bones
then
when they die
Ill dance
lost in wines light
and midnights lover
Illuminated memory, gallery where fates shadow roams.
Its not true that hell come. Its not true that he wont come
no more sweet metamorphoses of the girl made of silk
now she sleepwalks on the edge of fog
her awakening of a breathing hand
of a flower that blooms in the wind
for a minute of brief life
unique with open eyes
for a minute of seeing
little flowers in the brain
dancing like words in the mouth of a mute
She leaps with a shirt ablaze
from star to star.
from shadow to shadow.
The one who loves the wind
dies a distant death.
silence
I join myself to silence
I have joined myself to silence
and I let myself do
I let myself drink
I let myself speak
only thirst
not one encounter
be wary of me my love
be wary of the silent one in the desert
of the traveler with the empty glass
and of the shadow of her shadow
a feeble wind
full of folded faces
that I cut into shapes of objects to love
traveler from the heart of a black swallow
yours is solitude at midnight
yours the wise animals that inhabit your dream
waiting for the ancient word
yours love and its sound of cracked wind
I sing.
Its not an invocation.
Only names that return.
And are you afraid another love could destroy my love?
How bad you know what happens in me;
I have only one soul, already yours,
and a single heart that I already gave you.
And do you fear that stormy pleasures
could tear ah! of my heart the faith?
Pleasures are hateful to me;
thinking about you is my only pleasure.
Here dazzling women abound,
queens that are slaves of fashion,
dressed in silks and brilliants,
her eyes burn, as the sun burns.
Of those beautiful spells fascinate,
nectar flows from her carmine lips;
even more with her art and her luxury and her hairpieces,
none can compare to you.
Despite her great might,
they lack your grace and virtue,
and all of them together, my angel,
They cannot be worth what you are worth.
Your unparalleled purity is so huge,
and so enormous your beauty is,
That beauty can raise its temple
with the dust that you press with your foot.
No wonder it consumes me black boredom
since you are far from here,
and rightly my thought
it only has memory for you.
I think of you with ardent determination,
and I always look at your divine face,
and I call your name when I dream,
And I pronounce your name upon awakening.
If I withdraw from the swing of the world,
and eager to study I want to read,
between the letters ay! I look at your image,
your beautiful image of my life to be.
My heart of fire beats for you,
I need you as the soul to God;
you are the virgin that I idolize blind;
You are the glory I dream of.
ThoseÂ whoÂ haveÂ seenÂ yourÂ hump
sayÂ thatÂ youÂ areÂ offended,
andÂ someÂ believeÂ it,Â Fabio,
becauseÂ youÂ areÂ alwaysÂ burdened.
IÂ sayÂ thatÂ youÂ areÂ aÂ wineÂ kegÂ withÂ aÂ soul,
andÂ evenÂ aÂ manÂ inÂ shackles,
forÂ onÂ yourÂ backÂ youÂ carryÂ aÂ buttress
or,Â likeÂ aÂ sonnet,Â anÂ estrambote.
I entered, Lacro, in your garden
and I saw a lady or star
and an old woman or a keeper,
who was her guardian and her mastiff.
It's all so great
What did I think of the orchard?
that Adam lost, seeing in him
fruit, flower, Eve and snake.
A peasant that in his pantry
kept a cheese from Christmas,
heard a little mousy noise
by the periphery of his refreshment.
And soon, soon, as a ready man
whom nobody catches lacking,
brought the cat, so that in vigil
did on the scoundrel the sentinel.
And did it the cat with such success,
that both were gone: mouse and cheese.
Worthy and prudish governments,
where there is cheese do not send cats.
Soon the cadence will be broken
That maintains my lunar days.
My veins will be aged,
My body will have the voice
Of a finished summer.
Hot sparkles will take
The way to my hours.
—you do not oppress the gesture,
my universe surpasses
the limits of my body—
Hurrying before its time,
Drinking me,
Biting this life,
Running me without a brake,
It shares your fingers,
At the height of my touch.
The fire of my slow dusk,
Will be the light for strong arms,
In the wrinkles of your breath.
The hour blinks nervously
In the suspended time,
A bottomless, limitless happiness
Surrounds me, digs into me, licks me,
My agonizing fingers
In your sides,
Lost with the world
In a sigh.
The light is silent
The sound is turned off
The shaking scream
Lets the feathers fall
In our bed
Your closing eyes
On my conquered body
Take me to delirium
The hands of my beloved would grace a queen
If any queen were worthy of them!
Short little hands
With little flowers of blue among the snow
And tiny fingers
On which the nails like roses blow. 1
Hands, loving and compassionate,
With how much kindness they are ever placed
Upon my brow; white hands,
When by your aid to suffer well I'm braced,
'Tis very saints you are.
Divine magicians, you, when days are bright,
Augment my joy, clapping your child-like hands
With mad delight.
And ever, noble hands though slender,
You are extended needed aid to render.
And prudent, letting not fatigue o'erpower you,
You're like the little ants of life.
White hands with bluish veins,
Make my life good.
Dear little hands of mine,
Grant me my share of joy,
And, if you fairies are, fill full with flowers
The garden that our mutual love embowers.
And when I die,
Close you my eyelids,
But let them slowly close,
That so my darkened eyes may bear your image
Beyond death's bourne!
It was in the last ashen-gray days of autumn, in the solitary archipelagoes of the south.
I was with the silent fishermen, who in the brief twilight raise their patched and transparent sails.
We worked in silence, for the evening was descending upon us and upon the surging waters.
Clouds of purple, like great fishes, passed under the keel of our vessel. 
Clouds of purple flew over our heads.
And the swelling sails of the bark were like the wings of a great and tranquil bird that crossed noiselessly the red twilight.
I was with the taciturn fishermen, who voyage in the night and keep watch over the dreams of the sea.
On the distant southern horizon, hazy and lilac-colored, someone descried a flock of birds.
We were moving toward them and they were coming toward us.
When they began to cross over our masts, we heard their cries, and saw their brilliant eyes which in passing cast a hurried glance on us.
Rythmically they flew and flew, one behind the other, fleeing from the winter, 
toward the seas and lands of the north.
In their interminable flight, giving forth their short, harsh cries, they 
stretched in a sonorous arc from one horizon to the other.
Insensibly the coming night was making as one the sea, the sky, the ship, and ourselves.
Lost in the darkness, we heard the cry of the invisible wandering birds.
No longer did any one of them see its companion; none of them could distinguish anything in the fathomless air.
Leaves at the mercy of the wind, the night would disperse them.
But no; the night, which brings all things to a formless blackness, had no power over them.
The unwearied birds flew on, singing; and, if their flight carried them far, 
their song kept them united.
During the whole of the cold, long, autumn night, passed this endless flock of 
sea birds.
Meanwhile, on board the ship, like birds astray, the hearts of the fishermen 
fluttered within them with inuietude and longing.
Trembling unconsciously, agitated by fever, and knowing my duty toward my 
taciturn companions, I stood on deck and joined my voice to the choir of the 
wayfaring birds.
What does it matter, say, that it was temporary
our dream of love and madness,
if this present, that I call mine,
I barely live him, when I already die it?
Where is the eternal that I am always awaiting?
I now mistrust time so fleeting;
At life and its changes I smile.
Memory is the only lasting thing!
And in it, presently, although it is passed
In it you come, but without a future.
Memory is time... eternalized! 
Here I grow old, but in it I endure.
At my side your always loving smile...
I am only sure of my memory!
I've lived my years so absorbed
thinking without thinking, as in a dream,
that I was never the owner of my life,
command to live I only bear.
I tranquilize my being and comfort it
waiting for the end of a long dream:
to know once why this eagerness
to live and live. I exhort God
to reveal to me the good of this mystery.
I spent my years without knowing the when,
nor the how, nor the object of life;
and in my dream I am serious,
seeing that I have lived only loving,
perchance by loving, life finds its reason.
Water of God, solitude:
my body is swimming
through seas of oblivion...
May it reach your beaches alive.
To better gaze upon the night, 
I am standing on the shore of my life.
Oh, how many captive stars!
To better gaze upon the night,
I am standing next to the sleeping water.
I am standing with my back to the wind.
I am standing at the foot of a smile.
(Oh, how many captive stars
at the bottom of my wound!
Oh, how many captive stars
crowning my death throes!...)
I am dreaming beside the sleeping water.
Oh, how many stars on the shore!...
To better feel the night
I am going to pull its backbone from the fountain.
Oh, how many departed stars!
...............................................
(Silence stirs the branches...
A jasmine falls onto the water...
Oh, how many stars in my soul!)
I am going to sleep on the shores of Nothing.
Dawn
Dreaming cowl,
summer rain:
where goes 
the cloud in which you were born?
Forest echo,
heart of wind:
where the voice
that abandoned you in the sky?
Murmur of water
among soft rushes:
the sparkle of your current?
Human body fleeting,
slender reed:
where did your shadow forget
its nudity?
Beauty, solitude,
silent contemplation:
where is the true 
scent of your word?...
(The voice of God
resounds against the age...)
Where, does love
hide its mystery?
As a gleaming sword
with a thrust through my eyes
sorrow pierced my body.
It descends through me, stepping on my ruins;
colonizing the field of my dream.
Like a beam of light its fiery tears
moistened my blood
and I departed illuminated, pursued:
all my insides open to the new master.
The heiress to the sorrow of my madness
unleashed the currents of her army
and discovering my eyes now without borders,
my garrison fell to them.
Now I sing with the flower of my sadness
hidden in silence:
For what purpose am I to enter the grove
if it does not lead to eternity?
My body alive and I barely know it;
I can hardly perceive its form
and only when it passes through my dreams
do I feel from its sadness that in it I live.
I do not know its name, nor have I ever
known its name, nor do I want to know it.
Its name has to form itself in its memory:
the memory of me, that is not mine.
But I am born, already old it seems,
after so many hard gales, and, in it,
my tender nature is sharpened
for war now, at the edge of death,
just as before, my cowardly hope
was honed at birth together with my life.
O persistent form that in this way you ensnare
my thoughts in the spinning of the hours!
Where have you carried my eternal struggle
that you always find me disconsolate?
Yet the shadow of April approaches me,
like in other times, when a boy, I saw
its ardor encroach upon my nerves
to awaken its anguish in my blood.
Still its threat upsets my senses,
as yesterday it upset my sad childhood
among ghosts, dreams and resentments
in my first unprotected years . . .
Likewise it shows me its auroras
and wears away my hope for the same.
April, in war and peace, you always find me
unrecognized in the middle of combat,
near the leaves of my death, trembling,
naked, keeping your eternal flower:
like a tree, within my eternal grove;
like delicate grass, among my companions,
but equal to the essence of my fortune.
Always, on arrival, you see that my body
keeps the romantic form of its absence,
that excessive zeal names oblivion.
Me, always in my sadness, not recognizing me.
O, restless springtime, you conceal me,
sated by your ambition, from my own body!
April, April: what eternal adolescence
my continual rebirth though your branches!
Night arises
like a great wall of stone
and time is pushing it
without being able to demolish it...
Stars hang
on one side to sustain it:
the sun, from behind, supports it
with hands of glass;
water makes itself into a flag
and the wind a stanchion,
to better defend it
against its rival
whose determination does not cease...
All changes its course;
for night will not end
unless it attains its destiny. 
In front of its wall, raised
on a cross, I await my fate:
a gun shot in the silence,
a target in my solitude
that finally completes the mystery
of so much vain searching
for my name in my thought.
Above the wall of night,
in the phosphorescence of sleep
my finger moist with spirit 
is writing its sign...
—Although you dont see my body 
its life is here, death:
get here quickly, if you are to come.
Spit on my chest
and let your burning saliva
melt me into the black lime 
of the shadow of the eternity
that is now supporting me.
Thus will I lose my name
and, in losing it, I hope to attain
what I do not find by thinking 
and is the cause of my thinking...
In this sign I await you
and the font for this sign
is my complete knowledge.
Here I am. Dont doubt it any more.
Punch me without mercy.
and time pushes against it
unable to demolish it...
Faithful tree of truth,
face to face with night, my body
does not rest from waiting.
My eyes are now evening stars.
Like a knife, you thrust your burning
tongue into the shadow
and you go away and you leave it there
in its dark meat, throbbing,
like a small steel blade
of light, that in your love you sharpen.
How deep it reaches! how securely
it stays buried in the silence
and distributes stars to the night
of the entrails that it illuminates.
Like the skin of thought,
darkness is woven
and the body walks without shadow
and the heart without wound,
the same as in the limbo of the blind,
without shame and without happiness.
How many flooded eyes
and how much useless saliva . . .
and how good the stab
of your fiery tongue.
And, so true, in the exact
moment, your knife sank.
No one saw you. No one knew
who ignited its word,
nor why it was left
in mad alien shadow.
how the vision recovered . . .
No one saw you. No one knew,
nor recognized, your flight
Ruddy silversmith from up on high,
in whose bright beams the rabble pick their fleas:
Daphne, that nymph, who takes off and won't speak,
if you'd possess her, pay, and douse your light.
If you want to save yourself the pain,
oh, eye of heaven, try to buy her love:
Mars for bonbons sold his coat of mail,
and then his sword for jugs and sweet delights.
Stodgy Jupiter became a purse;
the maiden raised her skirt above her knees
in showers of coins to catch him on the run.
That was the doing of some duenna star,
—a star without a duenna it can't be—
Phoebus, get her help, since you're the sun
"An alchemist is running after you,
Daphne, he's called the Sun, and you're so rude?
Without a doubt you're acting like a bat,
since Sun and light you so swiftly elude.
He plans to have you, as I understand it,
if he can catch you in this forest dark:
his quiver's noisy, but his purse is voiceless;
the dog must be near death, since it won't bark.
A hawker of the signs and of the planets,
he's making funny faces, gesturing,
all laden down with steamy days and comets."
This I said; and to stiff laurel bark
she grafted herself on, to flee his wiles,
and the Sun, pickled, was left in the dark.
You search in Rome for Rome —oh, peregrine!—
and Rome in Rome itself you cannot find;
the walls she flaunted gape as corpses blind,
its own sepulture is the Aventine.
There lies, where once he reigned, the Palatine;
and Time has rasped her medals down, so that
they look more like the relics of combat
in ages gone than great Latiums signs.
Only the Tiber yet endures, whose current,
As it once washed the city, now bemoans the
tomb with tones sepulchrally susurrant.
Rome! In your beauty, your magnificence,
All that stood strong and firm has flown, and only
the fugitive remains with permanence.
Once there was a man stuck to a nose,
it was a nose more marvellous than weird,
it was a nearly living web of tubes,
it was a swordfish with an awful beard,
it was a sundial doomed to face the shade,
an elephant that looked up to the sky,
it was a nose of hangman and of scribe,
Ovidius Naso nostrilled all awry,
it was the bowsprit of a mighty ship,
like Egypt's pyramid it pierced the sky,
it was of noses all of the twelve tribes;
it was in noseness truly infinite,
an archnose shudder, and a frightening mask,
a monstrous chilblain, purpley and fried.
Within a curly storm of wavy gold
must swim great gulfs of pure and blazing light
my heart, for beauty eagerly athirst,
when your abundant tresses you unbind.
Just like Leander in a fire-tossed sea,
its love displays, extinguishes its life;
like Icarus, its golden path unsure,
its wings catch fire — in glorious flames it dies.
So very like the Phoenix, with its hopes
all burnt, whose expiration I lament,
it wants its death to make new lives from old.
So miserly and rich, in treasure poor,
in trials and humger Midas imitates;
Tantalus in a fleeting fount of gold.
Ah, Floralba!, I dreamt that... Shall I say it?
Yes, for dream it was: that we made love.
And who, if not a lover who was dreaming,
could blend with such a heaven such a hell?
My flames then with your snow and with your ice,
as often with his quiver's different darts,
Love sought to mix, and mixed quite decently,
my wakeful adoration to match well.
And I said: "May Love, may my fate decree
that I should never sleep, if I'm awake,
and if I sleep now, never leave this bed."
But from this sweet discord I soon awoke;
and I found that I was alive with death,
and I found that with living I was dead.
Perhaps whatever final shadow that
the shining day may bring could close my eyes,
and this my soul may well be set aflight
by time responding to its longing sighs;
but it will not, there on the farther shore
its memory leave behind, where once it burned:
my flame the icy current yet can swim,
and so severe a law can surely spurn.
Soul by no less than a god confined,
veins that such a blazing fire have fueled,
marrow to its glorious flames consigned:
the body will abandon, not its woes;
will soon be ash, but ash that is aware;
dust will be, but dust whose love still grows.
Formidable and frightfully resounds
within my heart the day when all will end;
and now the last hour, black, and cold, and drear
approaches, full of shadows and of fear.
If pleasant rest, serene tranquility
death offers me, dressed up to look like grief
her scorn to me resembles courtesy:
there's more caress in her than penalty.
What point is there so foolishly to dread
the one who to redeem with mercy comes
a spirit that in misery lies chained?
I beg she come, my welfare she insures;
thankful may she find me, not afraid;
she'll end my life, my living she'll arrange.
I looked upon my native country's walls,
if once they were strong, now they were decayed,
fatigued by time's inevitable race,
by which their former valor now must fade.
I went out to the fields; I saw the sun
drink up the brooks now freed from winter's ice,
and cattle of the mountain grumbling,
which with its shadows stole from day the light.
I went into my house; I saw that, stained,
it was just rubble of an ancient room;
my walking stick, more bowed and bearing less.
I saw my sword was overcome with age,
and nothing left on which to fix my glance
that was not a reminder now of death.
"Calling Life!" And no one answers me?
Come back, the yesteryears that I have lived!
Fortune all my time has chewed away;
the Hours my madness skillfully obscures.
Incapable of knowing how or where,
my health and all my years have swiftly fled!
Life cannot be grasped, just what was lived,
and there's no misery I don't endure.
Yesterday's gone; tomorrow's not arrived;
today's departing and it will not stop;
I am a was, a will be, an is tired.
In now, tomorrow, yesterday, I link
diapers and shroud, and I have thus become
visible stages of a man who's died.
Yesterday a dream; tomorrow dust!
Nothing, just before; just after, smoke!
And I plot out ambitions, and can claim
not one point on the siege that circling looms!
The briefest skirmish in a pressing war,
I bring great peril to my own defense;
while I consume myself with my own arms,
my body less gives lodging than entombs.
Yesterday's no more; tomorrow's late;
today moves on, and is, and was, with steps
that send me, headlong, down into death's cave.
The hour and the moment are mere spades
which, for the wages of my grief and woes,
now excavate in my life my own grave.
And love slipped away, shaken
By the hushed shores of your absence.
The night embodied your essence, and
The open fields surrendered, vanquished.
A yesteryear from your lips in my ears,
A resounding trace, a cadence turning
Your presence into a throbbing flower
Right by the last rim of oblivion.
You came afloat the scent of poppies.
Like whispers bursting aflame,
Under the gleam of full stars,
Lips rolled ahead like waves.
And, subdued under your eyes slumber,
Pain died down in the lush veins.
Berlin, my dilapidated city.Â 
You my lover, sublime aristocrat,
You the shameless rich kid, with your sunken eyes
And with superb runs in your black stockings.
Time-scabs peel off in streets
Publicly deserted.
How heavy, my love
The heaven over Berlin
When seagulls take their rest
And you are missing.
When between day and purple twilight grows
The broadening dawn, how sadly I awake
If I bethink its radiance will not break
Over my own sweet Lida ! They are woes—
The early dawn and purple . Swiftly flows,
As from the confines of a bursting lake,
Tear after tear for her long absence's sake:
Despair alone my sorrowing bosom knows.
Now of my bosom. Love with fiery torch
Makes a broad desert, all my soul inflames,
Yet finds my passion every morning new.
Each night Love goes within and shuts the porch,
When light and shade again are battling names.
So am I scourged with fire, so bathed in dew!
Tis said, the sight of blood so much
Is wont to infuriate
The tiger, that he still rends on
With stomach satiate;
Solely because tis his delight
With blood the earth to stain,
So doubtless with the King it was
Such feelings grew amain.
For when he saw Fadrique laid,
Thus prostrate on the ground,
After the squires in search he ran
The palace all around;
Who tremblingly and livid fled
The apartments various oer,
Nor find they any hiding-place,
Or whence to fly a door.
One happily at length succeeds,
To hide or fly outright;
The other, Sancho Villiegas,
Less happy or adroit,
Seeing the King still follow him,
Enterd half dead with fear
Where was Padillia on her couch,
With her attendants near;
They trembling, as she senseless laid,
And by her side reclined
Her two young tender girls, who were
Angels in form and mind.
The unhappy youth still seeing there
The spectre following nigh,
That even this asylum mocks,
In his arms quickly high
Snatches the Lady Beatrice,
Who scarce six years has known,
The child for whom the King has eer
The most affection shown.
But, ah! naught serves him this resource,
As in the desert naught
The holy cross avails, that clasps
The pilgrim hapless caught;
When roars the south wind, burns the sky,
And seems as if up-driven
A frightful sea, of waves of sand,
Commingling earth and heaven;
Thus with the child between his arms,
And on his knees compressd,
The furious dagger of the King
Was planted in his breast.
As if that day had witnessd naught
The palace new or rare,
The King sat at the table calm
To eat as usual there;
Playd afterwards a game of draughts,
Then went out pacing slow
To see the galleys, arming soon
To Biscays shores to go.
And when the night the hemisphere
Had with its mantle veild,
He enters in the Golden Tower,
Where he shut up has held
The fair Aldonza, whom he took
From Santa Claras walls,
And as in blind idolatry
Who now his heart enthralls.
With Levi then his treasurer,
Who though a Hebrew vile
Has all his confidence, he goes
On state affairs awhile;
And very late retires to rest,
With no attendants nigh,
Only a Moor, a wretch perforce,
His favourite waiting by.
Enterd the lofty vestibule,
The Alcazars tranquil bound,
One moment paused the King and passd
His gaze in turn around.
A large lamp from the vaulted roof
Was hanging loose, and cast
Now lights, now shadows, as it swung,
As by the breezes passd.
Between the polishd columns placed
Two men in armour were,
But only two dark figures showd,
Watching in silence there.
And still was Don Fadrique laid
Extended on the ground,
With his torn mantle oer him spread,
In a lake of blood around.
The King approachd him, and awhile
Attentively surveyd,
And seeing that his brother yet
Was not entirely dead,
Since he perchance as breathing seemd,
His breast a heave to make,
He gave him with his foot a push,
Which made the body shake;
Whereon he, giving to the Moor
His sharpend dagger bare,
Said, Finish him, and quietly
To sleep went up the stair.
Do you ask what is pain? ... An old friend
who inspires my deep complaints,
who is absent when you are with me,
who is with me when you go apart
Simple singer of a great discontent,
Among the shrubs the canopy keeps hidden,
Troubling the foliage with soft lament,
Nibbling myrtle, sour grape pips — wood pigeon!
Sings coo-roo-roo, glimpsing days first ascent
And later evenings brief reflected vision,
Sees from the gúaimaros¹ overspreading tent
Silent peace fill the slopes, that trees dominion.
Half-open the wings iridescent in the light,
Solitude —poor soul!— saddens its delight,
And it fluffs up its head feathers, a light hood.
To the maternal heartbeat of domains it holds
In its own entrails, it croons to mountains, folds
Them in sleep; light drowns in a dark wood.
Farewell, dear Fatherland, clime of the sun caress'd
Pearl of the Orient seas, our Eden lost!,
Gladly now I go to give thee this faded life's best,
And were it brighter, fresher, or more blest
Still would I give it thee, nor count the cost.
On the field of battle, 'mid the frenzy of fight,
Others have given their lives, without doubt or heed;
The place matters not-cypress or laurel or lily white,
Scaffold or open plain, combat or martyrdom's plight,
T is ever the same, to serve our home and country's need.
I die just when I see the dawn break,
Through the gloom of night, to herald the day;
And if color is lacking my blood thou shalt take,
Pour'd out at need for thy dear sake
To dye with its crimson the waking ray.
My dreams, when life first opened to me,
My dreams, when the hopes of youth beat high,
Were to see thy lov'd face, O gem of the Orient sea
From gloom and grief, from care and sorrow free;
No blush on thy brow, no tear in thine eye.
Dream of my life, my living and burning desire,
All hail ! cries the soul that is now to take flight;
All hail ! And sweet it is for thee to expire;
To die for thy sake, that thou mayst aspire;
And sleep in thy bosom eternity's long night.
If over my grave some day thou seest grow,
In the grassy sod, a humble flower,
Draw it to thy lips and kiss my soul so,
While I may feel on my brow in the cold tomb below
The touch of thy tenderness, thy breath's warm power.
Let the moon beam over me soft and serene,
Let the dawn shed over me its radiant flashes,
Let the wind with sad lament over me keen;
And if on my cross a bird should be seen,
Let it trill there its hymn of peace to my ashes.
Let the sun draw the vapors up to the sky,
And heavenward in purity bear my tardy protest
Let some kind soul o 'er my untimely fate sigh,
And in the still evening a prayer be lifted on high
From thee, 0 my country, that in God I may rest.
Pray for all those that hapless have died,
For all who have suffered the unmeasur'd pain;
For our mothers that bitterly their woes have cried,
For widows and orphans, for captives by torture tried
And then for thyself that redemption thou mayst gain.
And when the dark night wraps the graveyard around
With only the dead in their vigil to see
Break not my repose or the mystery profound
And perchance thou mayst hear a sad hymn resound
'T is I, O my country, raising a song unto thee.
And even my grave is remembered no more
Unmark'd by never a cross nor a stone
Let the plow sweep through it, the spade turn it o'er
That my ashes may carpet earthly floor,
Before into nothingness at last they are blown.
Then will oblivion bring to me no care
As over thy vales and plains I sweep;
Throbbing and cleansed in thy space and air
With color and light, with song and lament I fare,
Ever repeating the faith that I keep.
My Fatherland ador'd, that sadness to my sorrow lends
Beloved Filipinas, hear now my last good-by!
I give thee all: parents and kindred and friends
For I go where no slave before the oppressor bends,
Where faith can never kill, and God reigns e'er on high!
Farewell to you all, from my soul torn away,
Friends of my childhood in the home dispossessed!
Give thanks that I rest from the wearisome day!
Farewell to thee, too, sweet friend that lightened my way;
Beloved creatures all, farewell! In death there is rest!
A la juventud de AmÃ©rica
I look at the foam, delicate,
but different from the delicacy of ash.
Like looking on a life-giving smile,
a smile both exhaustion and hope,
I look now at the mere sea-foam.
This rough and beautiful moment,
this touch, the act of giving,
creating. The imprisoned pain
of the sea, saves itself in such light cloth;
under the keel, by the pier, where
furrowed love is, as on earth
the flower, foam is born and in it
death breaks. In its skein
where the sea becomes, as when in the height
of his passion man becomes, outside
other concerns: in his living milk.
At this wall, limit of the material,
a spring, not a mouth,
I am, when the tide
rises, and there I sink, there I drown
silently, with complete
acceptance, unhurt, renovated
in the everlasting foams.
From "Las Mayoas", IbizaTo Carlos Bousoño
Transparent calm. Facing the reddish
Earth, dried up down to its bowels,
With an aridness now scorching,
The Mediterranean sprawls. There's short pine,
Savin, agave, and thyme grows
And faithful rosemary, so severely
They hardly smell if not of saltpeter.
The north wind burns. The afternoon's dying.
Truth of obedience, of offerance,
Of downfalls, attritions
Facing the pure blue sea turning
Emerald green at the shore. Old and new
Erosion. Sheets, plates, cornices,
Cliffs and breakwaters, sharp
Angles, striations, splendor of rock
With its thousand-year permanence. Here
The truth of stone: never mute
But in its inner reflecting,
In the trembling of a constant
Harvest, perforining its sure labor,
Its sober secret tenderness beside
The sea, which is too much creature,
Too much beautv for man.
Old Latin sea that doesn't sing today,
Hardly speaks, whispers, prisoner
Of its unrelenting power, with
Feeble pulse, without waves,
Almost in clairvoyant silence
While the sky darkens and, dry
And dense, the last chance for love
Arrives. Between stones, among waves,
What is surrender and what, supremacy?
What lulls us, what torments us:
The glassy sea or the desolate earth?
Before the light reaches its anguish,
Early in the morning
And the petal becomes
The voice of childhood,
I live your risen and surprised shadow
Of humility, never dark,
With salt and sugar,
With its skyward trill,
Wounded and stirred at ground level.
Beside the mint,
This little nest
That is trembling, caressing
The field, almost
Inside the furrow,
Poppy without smoke,
You with your shadow and no despair
Accompany
My seedless oblivion.
I'm going with you.
You're not alone.
He arrived with a very shadowy breath,
Fasting,
With a dry craving,
Very sure and very free, unwearied,
Old now, with shiny
Wrinkles,
With his breathing so innocent,
His bold, secluded gaze.
He arrived, close-knit, well-sung
In his body, in his suit for no wedding,
With the radiance, so silent, of his pace.
He looked behind him
As if making cream before cheese,
With the sober and proud parchedness
Of his hands so soiled,
With his teeth cloudy,
Groping in the pollen of his mouth.
He arrived. I don't know his name,
But I'll always know it.
Dawn was starting to break with a cold silence,
The smell of resin and wine gone stale,
Amidst tavern and tumult.
And he said, "There's a sound
In the glass ..."
"What color?" I said. "You're lying."
He took out a dish and drew in the porcelain's
Belly,
With his seasoned fingernails,
His breath and the smoke from a cigarette,
A house,
A road made of quivering stone,
As children do.
"You see?
You hear the wind in the stone now?"
He blew on the drawing
And there was nothing there.
"Good-bye. I'm the King of Smoke."
When here comes the dawn, between light and purple
and I wake up so sad and I look at the day
and I can't find my white Filis,
dawn and purple and light darkens me.
I cry and my cry grows how much it grows
more the fire, and the shadow deviates;
and a clumsy ice like that ties me and cools me
that even the voice for relief dies me.
And at a point of trouble love with high fire
in this wide desert my chest,
where thinking enlivens it more and ignites:
So I cry and I burn like this and evil spreads
so much so that in the light, and in the shade and in the dew
I die in flames, and in tears I flood.
What do I see on this table? tigers. Borges, scissors, butterflies
that never flew, bones
which did not move this hand, empty
veins, unfathomable board?
Blindness I see. I see a spectacle
of madness, things that speak
only to be talking, to throw themselves
into the meagerness of that species
of kiss that approaches them. I see your face.
I see a swift river shine like a knife, splitting
my town of Lebú in two fragrant parts, I listen
to it, smell it, touch it, run its length in a child's kiss,
as when the wind and rain swung me, I feel it
like another artery between my temple and the pillow.
It's him. It's raining.
it's him. My father's arriving soaked. The smell
of a wet horse. It's Juan Antonio
Rojas crossing a river on horseback.
No news. The torrential night collapses
like a flooded mine, lightning makes it shiver.
Mother, he's coming home: let's open the door,
give me that lamp, I want to greet him
before my brothers. Let me bring him a good cup of wine
so he can relax, and clasp me in a kiss,
and stick me with the thorns of beard.
Here comes the man, here he comes
muddy, furious against misfortune, raging
against exploitation, dying of hunger,
here he comes in his Spanish poncho.
Ah, immortal miner, this is your house
of oak, that you built yourself. Come in:
I am your seventh son. I've come
to wait for you. It doesn't matter
that so many stars have gone through the sky of these years,
that we buried your wife in a terrible winter,
for you and she are multiplied. It
doesn't matter that the night has been as dark
for us as for the two of you.
Come in, don't stand there
looking at me, without seeing me, under the rain.
What do you love when you love, my God: the terrible light of life
or the light of death? What do you seek or find, what
is this: love? Who is it? woman, with her depth, her roses, volcanoes,
or this red sun, which is my furious blood
when I enter into her up to the final roots?
Or is it all a great game, my God, and there is no woman
nor man but one body only: yours,
split up in stars of beauty, in fleeting particles
of visible eternity?
Im dying in this, oh God, in this war
of coming and going among women in the streets, of not being able to love
three hundred of them at a time, because I am always condemned to one,
to this one, to this only one whom you gave me in the old paradise.
The three of them arrived at the same spot 
They ordered foaming drinks
They greeted the courteous multitude
All three went up to the same table
They drank smoking potions 
They knew nobody
They were not uncomfortable
And lo and behold, 
When all three jumped together
Over the cornice
Over the window
Over the hole
The woman at the bar said there was no reason to be afraid
Since they were a new flower brought from the East
But when they came down again and killed the whole multitude
She said before dying that there was nothing to fear 
That she had come upon the wrong garden
That she was mistaken about the flower
And that instead of blossoms from Buddha
She had brought blossoms of Uranium
Tell me if it starts to rain
and a big drop like a sun plummets
coming from heavens palm in crisscrossed lines
down to the crystal geranium sown among the wooden pots of the patio. 
Tell me, what should I do? 
Which psalm does that key unlock? 
And not tarrying there, it unveils a prism of reflections 
A drumming peace on the glass and the window
It incites the neighbors' envy
with an angry stone in their hands. 
Which gospel does that door knock down? 
And let loose on the skin
As it forgets its natural boundaries
It invades our bodies that lie
Stretched out in the dignified posture of love
Which word does that drop unleash?
To José Coronel Urtecho
When night comes and all leans on darkness,
when the night comes the sea might be asleep,
and all its strength may not suffice to move a single grain of sand,
to lend a smile to another face,
and a child may be born among its waves
when the night comes.
When night comes and the truth is a word like any other,
when all the dead holding hands form a chain around the world,
the blind may begin to walk as roots walk the slumbering earth;
they will walk holding the same heart from hand to hand,
and finding each other at last
they will touch their faces and bodies but not say their names,
and will experience a manual faith sharing its sap between them,
and the dead and the living will grow
within each other,
shaping a single tree that will fill the world completely,
I feel your whole body under mine.
Your flesh
is
like an ember,
fresh and essential,
flowing towards
my body, through a bridge
of slow and syllabic honey.
There's a single moment when the body
and the soul come together,
and feel reciprocal,
and live
their transfiguration,
and step one ahead
of the other in the same surrender
desired from the same origin.
I feel your lips on my lips, I feel
your skin naked and eager,
and I feel,
finally!,
that sudden freshness
like a blaze
of eternity, in which the flesh stops
being flesh and comes loose,
disperses in flight,
and starts falling
on the sleepwalking earth
of your body that gives
endlessly giving,
until
the flight ends and the flesh lies already
still, miracled,
and returns my body,
and all has been
a shock, a brilliance and then nothing.
A portrait of Dionisio Ridruejo
So how does a memory start? Wasnt it June?
The sky ripped open its gates
Over the Arga valley. Amidst the hills
The light marched in flickering obedience.
I remember how silence dimmed
The whole life tightly bound to its expanse:
The deserted roads, the city walls, and
The trail of fresh scent wafting from the pinewoods.
Listening to tolling bells I saw your eyes
Small and born of the earth,
Something playful and peasantly about them,
The gaze both slow and fixated,
Distrustful it was not, yet alert and ready
Not imperative, yet straight and close,
Hard, per chance, when locking eyes with one, and
That hardness comes in handy. 
Those eyes with no eyelashes, no
Eyelids even, almost lifeless,
Free yet moderate,
With that easy and spilled nonchalance.
So how does a memory start? The last light
Had wrapped up your face in mist,
Gaunt, small, fine and tender,
The gesture tired, the strength unflinching. 
The chestnut hair, and as you laugh
You cock your head ever so slightly;
The skin, rough and pale, the mouth
Blurred, worn-out yet smiling.
Bearing testimony to your life,
Your smallpox-scarred face,
Resting over it,
Great convalescing peace; 
Still today,
There you go, offering the peace that eludes you.
I remember you talking to me, your whole body
Finding solace in your voice, your voice being
She who carried the world in her hand,
Ample, certain, assured, true.
I rememberyet I dont know. When did you start
To take root behind the entire memory,
Just behind, as though a train advancing
Over two lives on the same single wheel?
The shadow of death at the threshold stops.
Oh dandÃºn, oh dandÃºn, do not look at its face.
Nearby, a dawn awaited you with hunger
for your limbs scarcely patted by the world,
and gave you the sweetest humming of sleep
from within a hazy, never-ending dream.
Your eyes are fixed, arrested: "How fixed
are dandÃºn's eyes." And you awake, dandÃºn,
it's true!, yes!, you awake!, and I adore your wail.
The bluish rivers will calm your anguish.
The shadow of death from the threshold advances.
Oh dandÃºn, oh dandÃºn, cover yourself with the sheets.
In his hands the kernel of the burburbur: window
wide open, almond that crackles, caterpillar,
bricks, steps, wheels: the chair gujgujguj,
the teaspoon, the cake, the bomberÃºn, the grampa,
the grampa, the grampa: "you put clock, or I put
teddy", burburbur, the jingle bell turns over
its beribboned chain: a sharp ting: a dimple
with syrup: dandÃºn in romper suit and joy.
The shadow of death is next to your bed.
Be good, my dandÃºn, better look at the dawn.
Your days go down a short corridor:
there are no gruff sentries for you discovering
the corners of magic, the furniture, the staircase:
on the floor tile dance your ranked soldiers.
In each black domino with which you play hides
a purple steam, a gash, an urgency,
and you play under the table at being a cat.
Nearby, a slow dawn plays at being a stone.
The shadow of death has leaned toward you,
(the pillow has turned blue):... two brothers.
You have looked at death and now you close your eyes,
but behind your eyelids you still go on looking at it,
and your closed eyes, terribly open,
look, look, endlessly, staring at what is unknown
of that faceless face which laughs laughlessly,
of that face, dandÃºn, which resembles you,
which is like some twin that you suddenly have:
tell me, dandÃºn, is death perhaps a daughter of mine?
The shadow of death has lain down in your bed.
My son, dandÃºn, you no longer belong to me.
No, no, not that, dandÃºn, the enormousness no,
the enormousness sticks to your lips,
you are going to surrender your eyes to a ghastly fog,
already it is enfolding you, dandÃºn, reject it, not that,
love me some, dandÃºn, to be mine,
love me some, dandÃºn,
just a bit more, don't go, dandÃºn;
oh God, and who would say that in your little body
you harbor an immense night, dismal,
starless, empty, full of infinity;
who would say that with your sweet, lost-colored eyes
you encompass a shadowy voracious wood, dandÃºn;
my soul, my son, dandÃºn, oh life, live,
vibrate, vibrate, turn over, live, live, untie!,
untie yourself!, untie me!,
may the moon shine again there in your pupils,
may the sun's cherries make you laugh,
may the birds fly through your radiant eyes,
may the wave toss again in your eyes,
may the day open in you like a soft bud,
may you behold my love as the wind does the dune,
My son, my blood stagnant in your veins
cries out to go through you, to feel you joyful
with strife, with Torrent, with greenery, with savor;
my son, my blood pooled in your veins
goes through my fibers of love of your flesh:
my blood, roll about, rebel, go through him
again, again;
don't rest, dandÃºn, forsake that dream,
come to my arms, son, full of light of life,
with the whole fragrance of the ripe bunch;
my blood, warm him, give him warmth again,
again give him shy vowels in his mouth.
Don't leave me, dandÃºn,
tell your blood to flow, to flow, to flow,
tell your eyes to open, son,
son!,
tell your fingers to grasp me.
Oh dandÃºn, if you are mine!, be with me always, hug me;
what is going to become of your games and of my blood, son?
Open your eyes, dandÃºn, for God's sake, dandÃºn, open your eyes.
Ah damned shadow, damned, damned God,
tell dandÃºn to open his eyes:
what is he going to sleep so long for!
Yes, dandÃºn, you are mine, mine alone,
don't go, son, tell me that all this is a game of the night,
that you are going to open your eyes.
Dawn, give me death.
My son of shadow, rest long.
Loneliness covers you with its veiling tulles.
The sky has become crowded with purple clouds.
The morning stumbles over the night in the bedroom.
The murky dawn has awaited you with hunger
From the threshold the sun, lying like a dog,
gazes at the still bedspread, comes down as far as your still
chest, proceeds to your pallidly still face
and in your closed eyes places a blind glint,
in your closed eyes, terribly open.
On its knees the Tree.
I fall on my eyes: I keep myself company:
I only have paths.
The light cries out: "I am now blind!"
Dusty, dissolute anxiety
breeds fresh meanings.
The feet of heaven stumble over my feet.
Ancient chiaroscuro:
paths and paths and not one
footprint. Never the world.
I sing like the sun,
and the sun does not sing.
I dream like God,
and God does not dream.
I, like the earth, die,
and the earth does not die, but sings!
—Did they come?
—He too?
—Yes, too.
—Did they sup?
—And He,
tell me,
and did He
sup,
did He sup?
— I don't know,
I don't know.
I do know, and the supper that got cold, too.
The cup of coffee, the coffeepot,
the steam that soothes my skeleton,
the obedient pan, the blackened
amulet, the mustard, the icebox,
the broken sink, the jaunty
tureen, the finicky airs of the flirtatious
iridescent vase, the parapet
of vanilla, saffron and spring.
Place of integrities: my free will...
Oh happy kitchen: when I die
and my time —without time— vibrates and grows,
in faithful purring may all that is mine and is clear
return to your wild mat
and may your steam —without end— dispel it.
Would that I were like snowy sand
surrounding a lily,
an acanthus leaf, molded to your belly
or a cotton flower that would hide in its cloud
the hardest Travertine marble.
Soft sheath of cloth, moulding of caresses,
would that I were, and around your young turgescence
I would make myself taut.
Would that I were your waist,
would that I were the hidden abyss of your groin,
round capitals for your thighs would that I were.
Would that I were, Calvin Klein.
There you can see the fishermen
with their dark coloured baggy trousers
swinging their straw baskets
with their arms akimbo
when talking out loud
the veins of their necks swell
And in each beautiful fish
you can see a different scale
in each scale a different colour
and in each colour a sparkle.
Bonus in good times, remedy
When times are hard; a master-key
That has the knack, knows how it's done,
Locks two strong wills to make them one;
Backbone of human conduct; sure 
Anchor of this life's insecure
Ship; the mild law that keeps the peace 
For everything the bright moon sees:
Friendship, pure goodness, heaven-sent, 
Gives its possessor instant gain,
Being itself its own self's fruit.
It's Mother Nature's natural bent: 
Who lives without it, can obtain 
Instruction from the soulless brute.
From dawn till morning, from afternoon till dusk,
from the spurious nightfall to the complete shadow,
something of our heart, in fatal losses.
—which take away the best of ourselves— falls step by step. 
We die in a repeated failure.
We drink too much of the ardent hanaycombs,
we drain happiness, and even evil
diminishes, and one day the glass is empty.
Let us have more strength for wishes and dreams
and for pain , for filling life
and for high flights, for the tenacious.
eagerness and the desire of never being tired...
Oh, let's pray not to die like this, from this wound,
fine and slow, which neither cuts us off nor ever closes.
The stone! I want to sing the stone:
O dark mother, mine, spread!
When my love takes her and caresses her,
in my hand it remains, pure and warm,
the dark shape of the Earth.
The stone is a flower asleep in her sadness,
foam of Death, grave flour.
Perhaps the stone is a smile:
the one of silence on her knees,
yeast of rabies and bones.
The stone in rennet, like dried fruit,
or in a multitude of motionless fantasy,
reminds man of his withered root:
She —the stone— beggar or summit,
it is always one beyond sementeras!
They all desire you but none of them love you.
No one can love you, you serpent,
for you are bereft of love,
you are as dry as dried straw
and you bear no fruit.
You have a soul like the skin of old men.
Face it. You can do little more
than inflame the hands of men, and seduce
them with the promise of your body.
But cheer up. In this profession of desire
there is none like you to feign innocence
and to beguile with those immense eyes.
Day broke without her.
It barely stirs.
Remembers.
(My eyes, grown thinner,
dream her.)
Absence is so simple!
On the leaves of time
The drop of this day
slips, shudders.
A wardrobe, a mirror, a chair,
no stars, my room, a window,
the night as always, and Im not hungry
with a bubble gum and a dream, one hope.
There are lot of men outside, and everywhere,
and beyond the fog, the morning.
There are cold trees, a dry land
steady fish are the same as water,
sleeping nests under warming doves.
There isnt a woman in here, I need one,
since many days my heart wanted to kneel
beneath some caress, or a word
The night is hard, between the walls, the shadow
slowly as the dead people, is dragging.
That woman and I were stuck by water
her skin under my bones
and my eyes inside her sight
we have dead lot of times
at the crack of dawn.
I remember her name,
her lips, her tranparent skirt
she had a sweety breast, and there was
a lot of distance in her body side by side
form nipple to nipple there are a hundred of lips and hour,
from pupile to pupile, a heart, and two tears
I lover her from the bottom of all the abysses,
from the last flight for the last wing.
When the flesh hadnt been flesh at all, and the soul
hadnt been either.
Its clear to love. I know I love her
Shes so hard, so warm, so clear!
I need her tonight
Theres a violin comming up from the street to my bed.
I looked two childs in front of a sideboard yesterday
the naked dummies were combing themselves.
The train whistle worried me for 3 years
nowadays I know its just a machine.
Any good bye its better than the everydays
to each thing, at the each moment, the tall
blood ulluminated.
Unprotected blood, soft night,
tobacco from insomnia, sadness bed.
Im going to go to another place
and I take my hand with me, wich speaks and writes a lot.
You can take the moon by the spoonful
or in capsules every two hours.
It's useful as a hypnotic and sedative
and besides it relieves
those who have had too much philosophy.
A piece of moon in your purse
works better than a rabbit's foot. 
Helps you find a lover
or get rich without anyone knowing,
and it staves off doctors and clinics.
You can give it to children like candy
when they've not gone to sleep,
and a few drops of moon in the eyes of the old
helps them to die in peace.
Put a new leaf of moon
under your pillow
and you'll see what you want to.
Always carry a little bottle of air of the moon
to keep you from drowning.
Give the key to the moon
to prisoners and the disappointed.
For those who are sentenced to death
and for those who are sentenced to life
there is no better tonic than the moon
in precise and regular doses.
The lovers fall silent.
Love is the finest, the most shuddering,
the most unendurable, silence.
The lovers seek,
they are the ones who relinquish,
those who change, who forget.
Their hearts tell them that what they look for,
what they seek, they will not find.
The lovers go around like lunatics
because they are alone, alone, alone;
yielding, giving themselves up at every turn,
crying because they cant hold on to their love.
Love obsesses them. The lovers live 
for today; knowing little else, its all they can do.
They are always going,
forever heading elsewhere.
They wait— 
for nothing, but they wait.
For what they know theyll never find.
Love is a perpetual prolongation,
always the next, no, the following, step. 
The lovers are incorrigible,
those who always —good for them!— have to be alone.
With serpents for arms, the lovers 
are the hydra of the tale;
their neck-veins, too, swell up, serpent-
like, in order to throttle them.
The lovers cannot sleep, 
for if they did the worms would devour them. 
They open their eyes in the darkness 
and terror seizes them.
They see scorpions beneath the sheets
and their bed floats as though on a lake.
The lovers are mad, stone mad,
forsaken of God and Satan.
Trembling and famished, 
the lovers come out of their caves
to hunt ghosts.
They laugh at those who know everything,
at those who love forever, heart and soul,
those who believe in love as in an lamp filled with inexhaustible oil.
The lovers play at gathering water,
at tattooing smoke, at going nowhere;
they play the long, sorrowful game of love.
You dont have to give in; 
no one has to give in, they say.
The thought of conforming to anything mortifies them. 
Hollowed out (picked clean from one rib to the next),
Death gradually distills behind their eyes,
and they cry and wander, adrift, until daybreak,
when trains and roosters bid their painful farewell. 
Sometimes, the smells of damp earth, of women
who sleep, soothed, a hand between their thighs,
of trickling water, and of kitchens, reaches them,
and the lovers begin to sing between pursed lips 
a song never learned.
And they go on crying, crying for
this beautiful life.
Miss X, yes, the curvy Miss Ecks,
has crossed my path, at least:
hovering about her brief,
infinite, unsuspecting etes.
She's as supple and clean
as dawn's tender breeze;
happy, smooth and deep
as grass under water.
She turns sad at times,
with that mural sadness that traces
speedy idols and sketches
troubles spectres on her face.
I think of her as a young girl
inquiring things of an old woman;
like a bewildered little donkey
entering a city, burdened with hay.
There's a grown woman in her, too,
who fills her eyes with sudden fear,
and moves inside her and tears up
her innards with acid tears.
Miss X, yes, who smiles at me
and doesn't want to tell me her name,
has told me now, standing on her shadow,
that she loves me, but doesn't love me.
I let her shake her head left and right,
saying no and no, until she tires of it
and my kiss on her hand leaves a winged
seed to bud serenely beneath her skin.
All day yesterday
the wet light glittered,
and Miss X went out, with a thin
cloak draped over her shoulders, in love.
She was never so girlish, never,
in a time so lovely, so lover-like.
Her hair fell on her brow,
her eyes, and my soul.
I took her by the hand and we walked
the whole of the rainy afternoon.
Ah, Miss X, Miss X, hidden
flower of dawn.
You'll not love her, sir, you don't know how to.
I'll see her tomorrow.
I love you at ten in the morning, at eleven, at twelve noon. I love you with my whole soul and my whole body, sometimes, on rainy afternoon. But at two in the afternoon, or at three, when I start to think about the two of us, and you thinking about dinner or the days work, or the amusements you dont have, I start to hate you with a dull hatred, with half of the hatred that I reserve for myself. 
Then I go back to loving you, when we go to bed and I feel that you are made for me, that in some way your knee and your belly are telling me that, that my hands are assuring me of that, and that there is nowhere I can come to or go to that is better than your body. The whole of you comes to meet me and for a moment we both disappear, we put ourselves into the mouth of God, until I tell you that I am hungry or sleepy. 
Every day I love you and hate you irreparable. And there are days, besides, there are hours, in which I dont know you, in which you are as strange to me as somebody elses wife. Men worry me, I worry about myself, my troubles bewilder me. Probably there is a long time when I dont think about you at all. So you see. Who could love you less than I do, my love?
My love, my dear, love suddenly
found in the oyster of death,
I want to eat with, be, love with you,
touch and watch you.
I tell myself, the blood pulsing
through my veins tells me,
and this pain and my shoes,
mouth and pillow, tell me so.
I love you, my dear love, absurdly,
foolishly, all lit up, head over heels,
rose-dreaming, conjuring stars; saying
goodbye to you walking beside you.
I love you from the pole on the corner,
from the carpet of that empty room,
on the warm sheets of your body
where a vase of poppies sleeps.
Long hair of the restless air,
river of night, dark banana grove,
blind beehive, unearthed love,
Ill follow your footsteps upwards,
from your feet to your thigh to your rib.
Source of sorrow, your
black pupils brand
and berate me. Your lips,
despite you, kiss me.
How you've sustained
that same dark look
with these eyes
trained on me now!
You smiled. What silence,
what lack of rejoicing!
How I sought you
out in your smile,
head of earth,
sad lips!
You don't cry, you wouldn't,
even if you wanted to;
your face has the burned-out look
of the blind.
You can laugh; I allow you
to, even though you can't.
Lets canonize the whores. Saturday night saints calendar: Bety, Lola, Margot, perpetual, reconstructed virgins, temporary martyrs full of grace, wellsprings of generosity.
You give pleasure, O world redeeming whore, and ask nothing in return but a couple of measly coins. You dont demand to be loved, respected, attended to; you dont go on like the wives with their whingeing, scolding and jealous fits. You force no one to make up or to bid you goodbye; you suck neither blood nor time; you are beyond reproach; you take the sinners to your breast, you listen to their words and dreams, you laugh and you kiss. You are patient, expert, long-suffering, wise, and free of resentment.
You deceive no one: you are honest, upright, and perfect. You name your price and you reveal yourself. You dont discriminate against the old, criminals, fools, or those of another colour. You suffer the assaults of pride, the snares of the sick; you soothe the impotent, stimulate the shy, gratify the satiated; conjure up the cure for the disenchanted. You are the drunkards confidante, refuge of the persecuted, rest bed of he who cannot find repose.  
You have educated your hands, mouth and muscles, your skin, your guts and your soul. You know how to dress and to undress; you lie down, and you move. You are precise in your rhythm, exact in your moan, docile in the ways of love.
You are freedom itself, and balance; you dont dominate or detain anyone; you dont get sentimental nor do you wait for anyone. You are pure presence, fluidity, perpetuity.
In the place in which you minister the truth and beauty of life, be it an elegant brothel, a discreet house or the makeshift beds of the poor, you are the same as a lamp or a glass of water or a slice of bread.
O whore of mine, lover, beloved, this and every days safe haven, I recognize you, I canonize you to one side of the hypocrites and the perverts, I give you all my money, I crown you with leaves of grass and I intend to learn from you for ever more.
It is the shadow of water,
and the echo of a sigh,
the remnant of a gaze,
memory of an absence,
a nakedness of a woman behind a glass.
She is enclosed, dead, finger
of the heart, she is your ring,
far from the mystery,
simple as a child.
Drops of light filled
empty eyes,
and a body of leaves and wings
went to the dew.
Drink her with the eyes,
fill her now, my love.
She is yours as if shes no ones,
yours like a suicide.
Rocks that I buried in the air,
trunks that I drowned in the river,
see my heart floating
over her simple body.
I hope to cure myself of you in a few days. I should stop smoking you, drinking you, thinking you. Its possible. 
By following now the prescriptions of morality. I prescribe for myself time, abstinence, solitude.
Does it seem okay that I only love you for a week? It is not a lot, nor a little, it is enough. In a week you can get together all 
of the love words that have been uttered on the earth and set fire to them. I am going to warm you by that furnace of burnt love. 
And also silence. Because the best love words are exchanged by two peoples who say nothing to each other.
You have to burn as well that other subversive side language of the lover. (You know how I tell you that I love you when 
I say: Its hot today, Could I get some water?, Do you know how to drive?, Its getting dark Between peoples, 
on one side your people and on the other mine, I told you, Its getting late, and you knew that I was really saying, I love you).
It would take another week to gather all the love of all time. To give it to you. So that you can do with it as you please: save it, 
caress it, toss it in the garbage. Its broken, thats for sure. I only want a week to understand it all. For this is a lot like leaving 
the mad house only to go to the grave.
How far does the country—the air off
the hills, the stars, the secretive clouds—
enter into the city at night?
When the factories shut down
and the engines sleep the way some men do,
step by step, trees filter into concrete streets,
and the cold spreads itself like a sheet of air,
climbs onto roof-tops, skulks in porches,
stills the water in the fountains.
Dead leaves, squirrels, rumours, alfalfa,
poplars, eucalyptus trees, adolescent vegetables,
insects, night wind, shadows even, steal in
to cleanse the city, to possess her.
(like a guilty and satisfied lover,
the country retreats at first light.)
Here we are gathered together again
in this house as in Noahs Ark:
Blanca, Irene, María and other girls,
Jorge, Eliseo, Óscar, Rafael...
Lets get to know each other quickly
and fornicate and forget ourselves.
The Ox, the Tiger, the Dove, the Alligator and the Ass, we all
drink together, and we walk on top of and run over each other
at this hour about to submerge in the nocturnal deluge.
Streaks of booze flash across the darkness of the pupils,
thunder and music contend with the noise of naked voices.
The house changes course and sails into the wee hours.
Who is holding your hand, Magdalena, buried in the pillows?
What a lovely occupation you have, to strip off your clothes
and light up the room!
Make love, my little dove, with all of your know-how:
your trained hands, your mouth, your eyes,
your expert heart!
Here we have the days head, Salome,
so that you dance in front of all the fiery eyes.
Be sure, Lesbia, not to take even a petal from our hands!
The house emerges from the whirlpool and time rises
like bitter flour. Here we are all together, fermenting,
our souls oozing from every pore.
Like a night full of drunken raptures,
such was life.
What did I do? What do I hold in my hands?
Longing, nothing but longing,
this chasing after dreams
the same as a blind dog barking at noises.
Slow, bitter animal
that I am, that I have been,
bitter since the tangle of dust and water and wind
that, in the first generation of man, asked something of God.
Bitter like those bitter minerals
that in the rights of exact solitude
—accursed and ruined solitude
without oneself—
climb the throat
and, crusts of silence,
suffocate, kill, revive.
Bitter like that bitter voice
before birth, before matter, that said
our word, that walked our path,
that died our death,
and that we discover in each moment.
Bitter from inside,
from what I am not,
—my skin as my tongue
from the first life
herald and prophecy.
Slow for centuries,
remote —there is nothing behind—,
far away, far off, unknown.
that I am, that I have been.
I've seen them at the movies,
in front of the theaters,
in the streetcars and in the parks,
fingers and eyes right.
In the dark halls girls offer
their breasts to hands
and open their mouths for the wet caress
and spread their thighs for unseen satyrs.
I've seen them make love to themselves in expectation, imagining
the pleasure their clothes are covering, the falseness
of the sweet talk they want to hear,
strangers to each other.
It's the flower that opens
through the longest day,
the heart that hopes,
trembling like a blind man in a prophecy.
That girl I saw today was fourteen,
beside her, her parents watched her laughter
as though she had stolen it.
Often I have watched them,
the lovers,
on the sidewalks, on the grass, under a tree,
meeting in the flesh,
sealing with their lips.
And I have seen the black sky
in which there are no birds,
and structures of steel
and poor houses, patios,
forgotten places.
And they're trembling constantly,
they put themselves in their hands,
and love smiles, moves them, instructs them
like an old disillusioned grandfather.
You have me in your hands
and you read me like an open book.
You know things that I dont know
and you tell me things I dont tell myself.
I learn more from you than from me,
you are like an all-hours miracle,
a dolour with no source.
If you were a man you would be my friend.
At times I want to tell you about the women
I pursue under your nose.
You are like forgiveness
and I am almost your son.
Ah, the beauty of your eyes when you are with me!
How distant and how absent you seem
when I sacrifice you to the solitude! 
Sweet as your name, as a fig, you await
me in the depths of your love till I return.
You are the same as my house,
you are like my death, my love.
My heart embarks from my body to your body
on its last voyage.
Offspring of light,
ageless waters that in you, woman astray, are born.
Come to my thirst. Now.
After everything. Before.
Come to my thirst long savoured
in mouths, scarce well-springs.
I love that rapt harp that lulls wild children
in your womb.
I love that taut moisture that arouses you,
that watery moisture that burns you.
Woman, gentle muscle.
The skin of a kiss between your breasts
darkened surf
roams in my mouth
and measures blood.
You, too. And it isnt too late.
We can still die in each others arms:
this no-mans land is yours and mine.
Woman, hatreds tenderness, ancient mother,
poison, flame, absence, bitter,
bitter sea, I want to enter,
penetrate, cross you.
Each cell is female, open country,
parted waters—a thing that opens.
I was born to enter you.
Im the arrow lodged in the loin of a dying gazelle.
Im poised to know you,
grain of anguish in a birds heart.
Ill be upon you, and every woman
everywhere will have a man on top of her.
Im not dying of love: Im dying of you,
my love—dying of the love of you,
of my dire need for my skin of you,
of my soul and my mouth of you,
of the miserable wretch I am without you.
Im dying of you and me, of both
of us, of this—
ripped to shreds, torn apart,
the two of us are dying, dying of it.
Were dying in my room where Im alone,
on my bed where youre missing,
in the streets where my arm goes unaccompanied,
at the movies and in parks, on trams,
in places where your head rested on my shoulder,
and my hand held yours,
and all of you I know like myself.
We die in places lent to air
so that you can be away from me,
and go to airless enclaves where
I cover you with my skin
and we come to know each other in ourselves,
unworlded, joy-saturated, without end.
Were dying, this we know, ignore, we are dying
together, now, sundered
each from the other, daily,
moulded into multiple statues,
in gestures we dont see,
in our hands that need us.
Were dying, love, Im dying in your womb
that I neither nibble nor kiss,
in your sweet and living thighs,
and in your unending flesh, Im dying of masks,
and of dark and incessant triangles.
Im dying of your body and of mine,
of our death, love, I, we, are dying.
In loves pit at all hours,
inconsolable, in sobs and screams
inside me, I mean to say, I call you,
those who are being born, who are coming from
behind, from you, those who reach you, are calling you.
We are dying, love, and, hour by hour,
we do nothing but die a little more,
and write and talk to each and die together.
My little love, you don't know it,
you can't possibly know it yet:
it's not your voice, the cold angel
of your mouth, nor your responses
to the sandalwood you breathe
and exude, that move me;
neither your ardent,
crucified virgin's stare.
Your eloquently expressed
anguish doesn't move me,
nor does your silent,
hopeless weeping.
Your melancholy gestures
don't move me;
nor your longing, your hope,
nor the wound
of which you talk, tormented.
It's your entire being—
your depicting your life
with such ungainly, cleansing
passion, that moves me,
like he who wants to kill himself
to be able to stay: I'm a suicide.
Leaf that hardly stirs
and already feels stricken:
I'm going to keep loving you
all day long.
I want to rest my head
in your hands: Lord
of smouldering shadow,
I want to rest my heart;
I want to cry my eyes out;
depart weeping, Lord.
Love, I'm weak, puny,
thwarted, tired of loving:
strike me with a blast of air,
heart, throw me away.
On the breeze, at dawn,
when the sun begins to wake,
shed me like a tear,
cry me as I cry.
All the entombed voices in the enormous graveyard of the air that girds the earth
will come back of a sudden to tell us man is merely this—
a diminishing sound, a ripple of laugher, a lament,
hastening unto death at the speed of his growth.
Skeleton of a shadow,
structure of a flight,
trace of a stone in the water,
desire, nothing but desire, dreams, just dreams.
With my eyes closed I see what it is I want
and what I want does not exist.
I'm not sure about this but I suppose
that a woman and a man
fall in love some day,
little by little, loneliness starts to set in:
something in their hearts tells them they're alone;
all alone, they enter one another;
they go on killing one another.
This all happens in silence. The way
the light enters the eye.
Love merges bodies.
In silence, they go on filling one another.
They'll wake up, arm in arm, one day,
thinking they know all there is to be known;
they'll see that they're naked and know.
(I'm not sure about this: I suppose)
(Londron 1833.)
Little angel, give me a kiss;
give me a kiss and a hug,
that your father is in the war 
more than two years ago,
and since then nothing is enough
to give me good times,
but a voice from your mouth,
but a kiss from your lips.
Poor boy!... how many tears
you have cost, miserable of me!
Angel from heaven, from your father 
you are the spitting image...
those rosy cheeks,
those blue eyes
that breathe only love...
That's all, there is no doubt,
that's all my Antonio ...
Learn, adored child,
to say like your mother:
ÂI love you, I love youÂ.
Mama, mama, why do you want me to sigh
when pronouncing it?
My son, give me a kiss.
My mother, I love you.
Came after the war
the sighing military man,
and by giving him a tender hug,
out of themselves, alienated,
son and mother repeated:
I want you to be my crystal,
you're so bright and clear.
I want to look through you
to the world's essence
of soot or beauty,
whichever way the day invents it.
Your presence here, yes,
always facing me
but always invisible,
true presence without my seeing you.
Crystal. Never a mirror!
My eyes are open,
but I cannot see you,
you're inside the fog.
Fog:
I cannot see through it,
push it away with my hand
kill it with my love.
Fog.
Why peer into it?
My will is  useless against it.
My eyes are closed.
I cannot see you, but now I feel you,
now I have you. You are
mine, I am at your side:
you are inside the fog.
I don't trust the rose
of paper
that I made so often
with my hands.
Nor do I trust the other
rose, the true one,
daughter of sun and season,
bride of the wind.
I trust in you, whom I never made,
in you, whom others never made,
in you, round
certain chance.
LA VOZ A TI DEBIDA[63] (Versos 2191 a 2219)
I don't want you to go,
pain, ultimate way of loving.
It makes me alive
when you hurt me,
not in you, nor here, further away,
in the earth, in the year where
you come from,
in her love
and all what it meant.
In that vanished reality
that denies itself
and insists on that
it has never existed,
that it was just a pretext by me
to live.
Were you no longer with me
pain, unrefutable,
I would believe it,
but you still stay.
Your truth ensures
that nothing was lie.
And while I do feel you,
you will be, pain,
the proof of another life
in which you didn't hurt.
The great proof, in the distance,
that it existed, that it exists,
and that she loved me, yes,
that I'm still in love with her.
The dry afternoon tapers off
and cuts —oneness of my soul!—
like a knife.
It plunges into an always:
time , which was an always,
is divided into yesterday, tomorrow.
And that lonely shadow,
the only one on the sand,
is split in two: you and me.
The winds sign in dry strokes
the fatal verdicts
of September, destinies.
Here is yours, there is mine.
Goodbyes without goodbye
or even a handkerchief. The steel blade
of autumn slices
our life in two halves.
That life,
perfectly whole, golden,
round, hanging there
on the branch of August
where you picked it.
Into a honeycomb full of delicious honey
two thousand flies arrived
and because of their sweet-tooth they died
with their feet imprisoned in it.
Another one, into a cake
buried in its sweets.
In the same way, if you examine
human hearts
they die in the prisons
of the vices that control them.
If you leave me,
do it noisily:
break the windows,
insult my memories,
throw each and every one to the ground
of my attempts
to reach you,
turns orgasms into screams,
strike the heat with rage
abandoned, dead calm, love
that does not resist,
destroy the house
That won't be a home again
Do it as you want,
but noisily.
Don't leave me alone with my silence.
The angels bending
To kiss her brow,
Sang unending—
Come with us now.
The child replying,
The angels drew
To her cradle lying:—
I'll go with you.
The angel faces
'Mid wings of gold,
Took her embraces
Within their hold.
And with the breaking
Of pallid day,
The crib forsaking,
They flew away.
Looking at this rose poem from the other side
what you see and what I watch is the rose.
The figure I watch and which you see
is one and the same thing
turned toward the light from behind.
to MarifÃ© and Pepe Piera
One can seek you beneath a cypress of foam,
in the fingers of air, metallic of dream,
in a volcano of birds ignited by snow
or in the voiceless waves of silvery fish.
You hide in rivers,
in leaves of rock,
in cold moons.
You live behind the veins,
on the edge of teeth,
invisible in the blood, naked, of dawn.
I have seen you many a time blaze against the glass panes,
leap in the pupils,
consume yourself in the echoes of a nameless abyss.
Your shadow gave me light,
caressed my face,
took form in my mouth.
And your glance burns, ice's lightning flash,
smoke in the eyebrows,
lava.
Oblivion's tree, you,
incessant body,
dove suspended above the vertigo.
There is a blue salt behind your eyebrows,
in your cheeks a sea of open fire,
an unspeakable tick-tock that carries me
as far as a deep god formed of foam.
And it is to observe the air,
to scrape the mystery,
to stab the shadow.
And I go on discovering you,
metallic woman, among the hawthorn:
a murmur of transparent blood
in the lost face of silence.
For you the light ascends at midday,
sand extending up to my lips,
thread of fiery and persistent earth
where space bursts forth more intense.
It is a geyser of foam,
of interrupted lava,
of an incomplete dove
that multiplies the air in a dimension of voices.
All is music, a tuning fork pitch.
In nothingness, even bodies make sounds.
I am not nor am I the otherMÃ¡rio de SÃ¡-Carneiro
What the water hides here is not a face,
nor what is heard beneath, its presence:
it is another identity, whose memory
not even forgetfulness could specify.
Beyond its voice the shadow vibrates
and states an I none other repeats,
as if time so alone in it were
the substance of an endless breath.
In the inner sense of touch of those seagulls
is an echo of shadows that leads
to an inclement weather wholly of crystal.
What the air lifts is its presence
which, in a measure of lights, dissolves
toward an open and single identity.
What a profound interior is this of air,
whose forms modulate its inexistence!
What can capture man but music
which quietly eternizes the sand in itself
and alone as the waves are distant
one by one, in oblivion, repeats endlessly?
Like his body, also, of shadow
and within its voice the salt is what endures
and that sound of echo in transparence
of one who knows nothing of another eternity.
Can music be something more that shadows
made to the measure of an idea,
engraved on glass by one who forgets
that he causes a god to come forth from among his notes?
Or that what we here call music could
very well be called the wing of a doubt
and the paradise firmly supported by
the trembling of columns within?
Night writes you,
transcribes you,
invents you.
Thus
on paper,
linen so alone,
time:
paper where night
would open by itself
the land of its effigy,
the figure,
the body from which arise
the invisible signs.
The
Earth by Night
Terra della Notte,
terracota or fate
or writing that invents
the distance in you,
what is behind you:
night's alphabet of nothingness.
The space 
—beneath the space—
takes the form of water
in Chantilly.
Not you, nor your memory.
Only the name
that your language writes
in your silence:
a speech of water
beyond all signs.
And you may leave me here, facing language,
in a single and same vastness
of extensive ink that erases me,
of tattooed night that nullifies me,
because nothing sounds in you,
keyboard, touch, tattooing. All:
distant correspondences extinguished, 
invisible writting, zero
of the nocturnal beginning
and of the end
One night,
One night all full of murmurs, of perfumes and the brush of wings,
Within whose mellow nuptial glooms there shone fantastic fireflies,
Meekly at my side, slender, hushed and pale,
As though with infinite presentiment of woe
Your very depths of being were troubled,—
By the path of flowers that led across the plain,
You came treading,
And the rounded moon
Through heaven's blue and infinite profound was shedding whiteness. 
And your shadow
Languid, delicate;
And my shadow,
Sketched by the white moonlight's ray
Upon the solemn sands
Of the path, were joined together,
As one together,
As one together in a great single shadow,
As one together in a great single shadow.— 
Another night
Alone—all my soul
Suffused with infinite woes and agonies of death,
Parted from you, by time, by the tomb and estrangement,
By the infinite gloom
Through which our voices fail to pierce,
Silent and lonely,
Along that road I journeyed— 
And the dogs were heard barking at the moon,
At the pale-faced moon,
And the croaking
Of the frogs— 
I was pierced with cold, such cold as on your bed
Came over your cheeks, your breasts, your adorable hands,
Between the snowy whiteness
Of your mortuary sheets;
It was the cold of the sepulchre, the chill of death,
The frost of nothingness.—
And my shadow
Sketched by the white moonlight's ray,
Went on alone,
Went on alone over the solitary wastes;
And your shadow, slender and light,
Languid, delicate,
As on that soft night of your springtime death,
As on that night filled with murmurs, with perfumes and the brush of
wings,
Came near and walked with me,
Came near and walked with me — Oh, shadows interlaced!—
Oh, shadows of the bodies joining in shadow of the souls!—
Oh, shadows running each to each in the nights of woes and tears!—
I'm going. My body is already tight
like an old suit.
The steers are over, poet.
It's time to go back
to the clear school of silence.
Shed the words, the mourning,
the poor verses.
Get light of heart and of memories
for the endless journey.
The pale ivory, polished and beautiful,
its forehead does not have whiteness,
nor the rose of Lima hers beauty,
nor the regal swan hers nervous neck.
Nor the red sun the vivid flash
that in her languid glance flashes,
when in her mind is portrayed pure
the cascade of light from her hair.
The dove does not have her innocence,
nor the kind jasmine the warm essence
with which she perfumes her fiery mouth.
Greek marble does not have her silhouette,
nor her lover complains of her voice the prayer...
Not even her adorable stupidity the rock!
You said to me: My father did not weep, 
Nor my grandfather weep". I heard you say: 
No man of all my race has ever wept,; 
of steel were they.
And thus upon my trembling mouth I felt 
The poison of your bitter teardrop fall, 
Worse potion than my lips have ever quaffed 
From a cup so small. 
Weak woman, born all grief to comprehend, 
I drank the pain of ages infinite; 
But oh, my wretched soul cannot support 
The weight of it!
Thou who hast fled from life's enchanted bowers
In youth's gay spring, in beauty's glowing morn
Leaving thy bright array, thy 'path of flowers,
For the rude convent-garb and couch of thorn;
Thou that escaping from a world of cares,
Hast found thy haven in devotion's fane,
As to the port the fearful bark repairs,
To shun the midnight perils of the main;
Now the glad hymn, the strain of rapture pour
While on thy soul the beams of glory rise!
For if the pilot hail the welcome shore
With shouts of triumph swelling to the skies,
Oh, how should'st thou the exulting paean raise
Now heaven's bright harbor opens to thy gaze!
Under the sky born after the rain,
I hear the quiet slap of oars against the water
and Im thinking: happiness is nothing
but the quiet slap of oars against the water.
Or maybe its nothing but the light
on a small boat, appearing and disappearing
on the dark swell of years
slow as a funeral supper.
Or the light of a house discovered behind the hill
when wed thought nothing remained but to walk and walk.
Or the gulf of silence
between my voice and the voice of someone
revealing to me the true names of things
simply by calling them up: poplars, roofs.
The distance between the clinking of a bell
on a sheeps neck at dawn
and the thud of a door closing after a party.
The space between the cry of a wounded bird out on the marsh
and the folded wings of a butterfly
just over the crest of a wind-swept ridge.
That was happiness:
drawing random figures in the frost,
fully aware theyd hardly last at all,
breaking off a pine bough on the spur of the moment
to write our names in the damp ground,
catching a piece of thistledown
to try and stop the flight of a whole season.
Thats what happiness was like:
brief as the dream of a felled sweet acacia tree
or the dance of a crazy old woman in front of a broken mirror.
Happy days pass as quickly as the journey
of a star cut loose from the sky, but it doesnt matter.
We can always reconstruct them from memory,
just as the boy sent out to the courtyard for punishment
collects pebbles to form resplendent armies.
We can always be in the day thats neither yesterday nor tomorrow,
gazing up at a sky born after the rain
and listening from afar
to a quiet slap of oars against the water.
Bright lights of the heavens and bright eyes
in the dreadful face of the night,
bright crown and bright Cassiopeia,
Andromeda and Perseus,
you, with whom the divine Virgin, daughter
of the ruler of mighty Olympus, spends
the wide expansive hours of the night
watch that is her lot,
listen to my complaints, for these my tears
are clearly signs of no mild grief;
let them not be lost as always
tears once shed are lost.
How often have you seen me weeping,
as Cynthia too has seen me in my distress
for the lukewarm zeal with which her sleeping
shepherd adores her beauty!
How often did bright Aurora find me,
a grieving spirit, wandering
the rough, lonely, deserted vales
weeping for my painful fate!
How often when she saw me so sad
did her pity for my grief cause her
to shed bitter and piteous tears
with which she beautified the flowers!
You stars, you also saw me alone,
faithful companion of your silence,
walking through the quiet night,
full of evil suspicions.
I saw the cruel Circe who persecutes me,
brewing grim spells from the leaves and flowers
of my hope, well before its time
arbitrarily cut down.
Cruel vision in which the glory I once
adored for its firmness fell away,
and in which was endangered the hope of a life
envied by fortune itself.
Ay! Let me be, you heavens, for the glory,
that comes through good fortune and by her hand,
will not for ever be desired
by my afflicted spirit!
Night, who in your loving sweet oblivion
provide security and comfort for
the cares of hostile day, and compensate
the senses for the labours they endured.
You that have led me from my grief away
to gaze on you and contemplate my fates,
hostile and all banded now together
against a man the heavens persecute.
May the bright and shining lamps of heaven
always give you light, and may your friendly
brow be bound with cypress and with nightshade.
May the bright sun never shed his light
on this spot while I must mourn my absence
from my love. How well you know my life!
Silence, I regard your starry mantle,
adorned with numerous transparent lights,
staunch enemy of the illustrious Sun,
nocturnal bird with song of prophesy.
The false magician Love, who casts a spell
of words dismembered by oblivion,
transformed my reason and all that I feel,
but had my body melt in misery.
You, who know my grief, and you, who were
the principal occasion of my strife,
because of whom I was both blessed and cursed,
hear my pain alone, since for a poor man
persecuted by a violent sky,
awareness of his suffering makes things worse.
I am in SÃ³ller, love.
I came on train.
I write a postcard
and I put it in the envelope.
I still remember your name
and Post office Section 3
of a town
where I'll never be.
Come to save me, love:
I have already been shipwrecked.
I write with my blood
on a fiery piece of paper.
The bottle is broken
and without stopper.
The sea is choppy 
the hurricane is coming.
Come to save me, love.
May God bless you tragic clown,
you who combine tears with laughter;
when death threatens our heart, you cool
our brow with a fresh, gentle wind;
your cheerful spirit heals our sorrow,
at least for a while, and in this way
we can live, since without you the pain
would quickly destroy our soul.
Clown, you are the remedy for grief;
thanks to you we receive the nourishment
which sustains our spiritual life;
only a bow which is loosened can shoot;
in order to live, to suffer, we laugh;
so let us laugh, since we are born to suffer.

SÓFOCLES. Antígona 615 1
Immortal hope, spirit that waits for
the eternal Messiah who you know
will never come, you who protect
your daughter, faith, with seven keys
and who is never intimidated by reason,
when you do not turn our hearts into birds
that can fly above the dark clouds
of grim truth, I can no longer feel you.
Immortal hope, divine bird!...
because my soul is too shallow for you
you are stifled in it, and because of that
I have lost your protection
and now, without you, I struggle to see
if, struggling blindly, I can forget you.
Salamanca. 30 December 1910.
But no, immortal one, you are eternal
since you live outside of us, a Holy
Spirit in the depths of God, and you will
always return under your ageless mantle
to shelter our poor bitter spirits
and make our afflictions fruitful;
only you can cure mortal sorrow,
only you can give meaning to your tears.
I am waiting for you, essence of life;
I will not walk like a soul who is caught up
in the motions of a macabre dance
since my life has purpose; with my weakness
I will lay a foundation for your strength
and while I live I will hold on to you, Hope!
Cover me with your wings, dear angel;
by making a cloud which never passes,
you protect the mind which is burned
by the face of God, as we float down
the river of destiny. Thus, I am sure
that when I return to my Fathers house
and the truth is revealed, I will be free
to see everything much more clearly.
You know, dear angel, that life is short;
although it can also be quite difficult,
and in it the soul is unable to stay close
to its God. So I will wait till I die
to see Him, since only death reveals
the full extent of the Truth.
This hungry vulture, with his severe
frown who voraciously devours my entrails
and consumes my sorrows with his curved
beak, is my only constant companion.
When the day comes that he is ready
to drink the last swallow of my blood,
I want to be completely alone with him
for a moment, without anyone to disturb us.
In my final agony, when he takes the last
bite of my innards, I want to have the pleasure
of seeing his expression of surprise
when he sees the fate which awaits him:
being without the prey with which he has sated
his atrocious hunger which will never end.
When you could not be the Christ you
rejected Him, the superhuman archetype;
a hunger for eternity filled your pour souls
longing until the sad moment of your death.
Hoping to break through the barrier to
the hereafter you gave your suffering heart
the eternal return, oh Oedipus reborn,
victim of the Sphinx you thought you had
conquered. Feeling inside you were a slave,
you preached domination, and it was a complaint
that sounded like the laughter of a fierce lion;
you battled with fate in a tenacious
struggle to keep on living, to only die
finally free from reason, our torment.
White Eagle with resplendent eyes
who drinks the light of the timeless Sun,
you give it to us, pelican, converted
into the blood from your own veins;
White Eagle, why does that black
cloud veil your eyes like a Nazarene
crest? You give us light; your heart
is a burning torch that illumines us
and lets us fill our blood
with your light. Yes, You are the Man
who casts light on the world of mortals.
Light, Christ the Lord, light that is life!
When we die in the wings of the Empress
of Death, carry us to the Sun in your
white arms, so that we can rest
our eyes on it, so that we can see
the face of Truth that kills man
in order to resurrect him; White Eagle
whose divine eyes absorb streams
of living light from the eternal Sun,
you gave it to us in the blood you shed;
take us to drink the light of the eternal
Sun with our own eyes, so we can see
the face of Truth. Let the owls
of Minerva (who can only see in the dark
since they are blinded by the sun)
seek their prey at night. Not owls;
our souls are eagles who, when they die,
live to see the face of God. Give us
eyes of pure faith that are able
to withstand the dazzling light of Truth,
of the Sun that is never extinguished,
of the face of God who gives us life
when He gives us death with His gaze!
He breathed his last...
The breeze that blows over the fields
infuses our bread with sunlight
and melts the snow on the mountain peaks;
and in the forest it rocks the leaves
with dreams of solitude, and above
the boundless sea it sings a lullaby
that enflames the earth with its waves;
there were sighs from your loving breast
and from the mountain sides your words
took flight as though from a nest.
You, the Word, without air, or a voice.
Out of the blue it entered your lungs
where it felt at home, and collecting
the fluid from your blood, it poured out
in showers over the wild flowers.
The last burst of of air from your chest
broke the cold silence, and then your lungs
were empty; your breath was absorbed
by that of your Father: a rivulet into the sea!
When I struggle, calmness overwhelms me
hiding your secret from me, Destiny;
don't let me falter in my path, because
without questioning I obey you blindly.
Don't give me time to complain or beg;
spur me on without stopping,
and, like a sleepless pilgrim, let me
carry with me the fire from my hearth.
I want to win my peace through war;
I want to conquer the impossible dream;
don't let me rest from trying to shed light
on the enigma within your heart,
and when I return to the bosom of the earth
let me deserve an ever-lasting peace.
Only our homelands can teach us
the ideal of human brotherhood, because
it is from our homeland that the faith in our
destiny emanates, the faith that is directed
toward the God of All. Although His face
is hidden by the clouds of Sinai, He comes
to give Moses the tablets and the mysteries
before His law is revealed in a homeland.
Oh God of Covadonga and Roncesvalles,
God of Bailén, Lord of hosts,
may your name be blessed in heaven
and in the hills and valleys of Spain,
and as I make my confession, do not silence
my voice as long as I can breathe her air.
A successor to Pilate, you hand over Christ
to the successor of Ananias, that is, to the Pope,
because, Secular authority does not create
laws to protect dreamers; then you say:
I do not assume this authority because of
some extra-religious agency; I have nothing
against Man as God, but I refuse to allow
them to convert the nation into a Travesty.
A free Church in a free State, and you foist
on us a Christ who has become a mockery,
thinking that it will serve your purpose.
But you are chastened, because whoever tries
to combine the two powers does not understand
that when you have both, one is more than enough.
You are white like the sky in the east
is white at dawn, just before the sun frees
the earth from the limbo of night:
you gave the whiteness of dawn to our life
which is the dawning of death, the door
to eternal life; white like the pillar of cloud
which guided the people of the Lord
through the desert during the day.
White like the snow on remote mountain
peaks, surrounded by the heavens
where the sunlight always shines;
from your body (which is the highest peak
of life) fall crystal pure waters
that reflect light from the heavens
and flow through the deep caverns
of darkness hemmed in by the abyss.
Like the highest point of the night,
like the moon that foreshadows the dawn
to those who are lost in the depths,
your snowy-white body, the apex
of humanity and origin of the rivers,
brings an eternal dawn to our night!
Enamored of your body and linked
to it by universal love, your soul
abandoned it in death, not like one who
escapes from prison with a sigh of relief,
but like a home where one longs
to abide forever, in the normal state
of happiness. The final lament came
from a fathomless source, the separation
of flesh that was torn from a spirit
that had become flesh. Silence continued.
And when all was quiet in an intimate calm,
everything became dark; light is music,
but alas for the believer who cannot hear it!
Resting in the cold darkness while it
recovers from its agony, your soul gazes
on its former body which it has left
in the claws of the cross, hanging from
the nails, and as it looks, it feels a love
even more vital than life itself. Without it,
how could it bask in the Sun? Where
could it catch the light? How could it
reach for the hand of the Father in order
to grasp it? And with an obscure fear
of merging with an endless darkness
and vanishing like a gust of wind, it longed
to return to its vessel—flesh and bone—;
it misses the infinite beauty of its body
and tries to find its borders; it wants to feel
the boundaries of its territory; it longs
to be contained within its limits!
White amphora of divine liquor
decanted throughout the centuries,
the immortal Potter has shaped you
with the arm that made Adam, and his wheel
keeps on turning. From the same clay
new vessels of sorrows and love
have come to shatter against the earth!
Give us, Lord, a fervent desire
to love You; a yearning amid battles
with the Enemy, who never ceases
to pursue us. Man tends be complacent
about his ability to love, but complacency
does not fit with love. Not even in our
fondest dreams can we touch your body;
because in this prodigious work of art
both miraculous and non-material
you shy away from physical contact
with this humble world. May our love
be like an unripe grape in the vineyard
of this stony ground, so that in the light
of the brilliant Sun of eternal Glory
it will ripen forever. Be the bread that
makes us hunger for you; be the wine
that makes us thirst for you. While we live
on this earth, may our life be filled with
the desire to love You: may it rest
after a fruitful love, and sleep is not
life, but death. Here in this sad valley
of dreams and bitterness, Humanity
never achieves fulfillment. From our souls,
poor caterpillars, may butterflies emerge
that, in the burning light from your eyes,
will always be reborn. From now on
we strive to reach a higher goal.
Your Bride, the Church,
sings of your passion, and nourishes its hope
with songs, until your image is wrapped
in an aura of beautiful harmony.
Sea shells from forgotten centuries,
psalmodies resound in the cloisters
like dying waves on a timeless beach,
and from all corners of the world came
pleas from the souls asking You,
for the love of God, to rest in peace!
At night, moon, your brightness
mirrors the white lake of sorrow
in this valley of tears; its greenness
is reflected in the waters, and its rocks
are small islands where outcast souls await
their freedom. Frozen stiff, the poor things
tremble like the dry leaves of poplar trees
in November on the banks of the river,
and when they fall, it gathers them
in its bosom and carries them to the sea.
Pressed against the wood of the cross
these poor souls tremble in the cold wind
and rain from the dark and gloomy chasm
which threatens with its deep rumbling;
like a miserere of dry leaves, there are
sobs of passion which cannot be contained.
The cluster of souls forms the dark foliage
of the tree of the cross and, united by it
in the brotherhood of love, they tremble
in unison when they see the head
of the white Nazarene which is crowned
with hair as black as the night; and when
the north wind from the abyss finally
blows them out of the mysterious tree,
they fall down over the white breast
of the Christ, and at his feet they disappear
into the river of blood which carries them
to an eternal life in the unfathomable sea.
In the bright moonlight, a river of blood
from the heart of the Christ flows through
this valley of tears and carries,
in a rippling and sorrowful eddy,
a throng of souls like scorched leaves.
And your blood destroys the foundations
of the stronghold of that archenemy
of the human family, and who is the mother
of weariness and desperation.
Your body shines like a brook in the sun,
a vein of silver in the blackness
of the rocks that enclose its channel;
the waters form a single current
above the abiding depths of the soul.
We bathe ourselves in You, a Jordan of flesh,
and in You we are born of water and of spirit.
From your face in the waterwaves of silver
we see the spirit descend as a dove from heaven:
its wings merge with the waves,
seeming to fly through the depths
of the bed of your waters. You baptize
with the Holy Spirit; you submerge us
in an everlasting sea, which is pure light.
The image of the spirit is reflected
in your breast, and for us the dove,
a white tongue of fire, seems like
a snowflake that falls from your lap.
You, Jesus, are like a living fountain
in the depths of the forest that sings
pure songs of eternal love.
Lord, fight with me and never neglect me;
let me feel it when your hand crushes mine,
that you are treating me like a brother,
Father, since I am able to struggle
with you; this battle is proof
of the divine origin of humanity.
Struggling like this, I find support for
my faith in the mystery of your power.
Since the battle continues during the dark
night of this life and the hour of dawn
is approaching, Lord, tell me your name;
you have already taken away my armor
and now that my soul is vanquished it cannot
rest until it finally exits from this dark path.
Quidquid cogitari vel desiderari
Potest es minus quam Deus.
Atheism is a facile accusation
that is used to persecute the innocent,
but it is only an insulting nickname
reducing God to an unfathomable abyss
in which all is ultimately one and the same
and therefore no one will ever run out of
misinterpretations; with the catechism
they have turned us into halfwits.
When we want to believe, our faith
gives us hope which makes us say:
God, I believe in you! thus creating
Him in our image. God is the desire
to be a god ourselves that is never achieved;
who knows, perhaps God Himself is an atheist!
With His invisible hands beneath yours
which were enlightened by blood, your Father
holds up your cross which covers the vastness
like scales that were used to weigh the stars.
Your pierced right hand offers freedom,
and with the hand of the heart you reveal
the equality which made you like us
each being the same cross-timber
and from the center of the cross to the sky,
like an offshoot, the stout beam
of brotherhood rises up from your heart,
the headboard of your deathbed
and the basis of Salvation. And the shape
of your cross is a trefoil which represents
the distant Triune God. You uphold
the infinite, and the oneness of the human
race; through your body we are brothers
and the children of your father. The sign,
where an astute Pilate attempted to indicate
the status of your royalty, is shining
above the headboard of your deathbed.
Death made you a reluctant king,
as proclaimed by the multitudes
when your gifts satisfied their hunger.
Discussions taking place in the refectory:
The offering loaf is blacker every day
It looks like the acorn from a gall-oak
This is whats become of the offertory!
It is a well-known decree of God,
when we insist on the best quality wheat,
He will punish us for our gluttony.
Purgatory must be in bankruptcy!
and so now the Church is in ruin
Every day the faithful become more obstinate
It is useless that we sing holy, holy, holy
because in times of impious democracy
the flock gets used to freedom
and cannot tolerate shysters of grace.
Only the cross supports you, the trunk
to which you are bound, a dead tree
without roots, without leaves or fruit,
a raft rocked by the random changes
in the infinite motion of earth and sky,
the holy wood on which the soul floats,
caught between the two eternities.
Asleep on the sea under the lightdarkness
its sturdy headboard rocks
like the prow of a ship; a luminous
trail of foam rises and fallsstars
and the waves wash over its arms
where souls who bemoan their sorrows
go to take shelter. And spread out
above it is the other sea, the sea of sky,
black and unfathomable and endless,
and there, where the two seas meet,
where all that lives resides: the Sun!
Beneath the white wings of your arms,
which are open, like those of a mother
holding a child who is learning to walk,
like a hen who protects her chicks,
you shelter us. Your two arms are wings
that open and bring our sweet death
to life; they open like the white sails
of your divine heart which travel
over the deep and boundless sea
beyond our vision. Your white arms
are two radiant wings of God,
wings of the Spirit that moves over
the face of the dark waters filled with
the pain of living. Your arms reach
in both directions, Sower who sows
your blood in our hearts; on them
sprout lilies of whiteness. Then,
from the white cloud where you rest,
with the same hand with which you sow,
you cast to earth the scythe that will
reap your harvest when it is time!
And bowing his head...
Your head bows down over your breast
like a white lily that is withered
by the sun; sadness caused by the awareness
of evil makes You lower your ivory brow.
As though your face were hidden
and shamed by its common humanity.
Consumed by pain, you bear all the sorrow
of the world. Only You can know
the evil that is done by men,
and it weighs You down, since You embrace
their deepest flaws with your vision,
since the soul becomes that which it knows.
With your vision of love which nothing
can escape, you take up our sins,
but when you pardon the sins of mankind
you do not pardon Yourself,
the only Son of Man who is free from sin:
You, the only one who comprehends it.
And so You took sin upon yourself,
the bitter knowledge of good and evil,
which lets you be God as well as man,
since for our sake you have become sin,
and heaven is filled with souls you have stolen
from the world, by acting as a thief.
We wounded you and, like a deer
who runs off to die in its familiar thicket,
You escaped from the Mount of Calvary,
dying of thirst and the loss of blood,
passing through paths of bitterness
to the heavenly source of your love;
I thirst, you cried. And we,
your brothers and cruel hunters,
who were also dying of thirst, sought
the source of your wine by following
your bloody trail through this sad life.
During the wedding in Cana you turned
water into wine, but in the martyrdom
of your passion you changed red wine
into the living water of Sychar, which
quenches thirst forever. You gladly gave
your blood, as a mystical exchange
for our soulsSamaritans
with six husbands, maddened concubines
of knowledge that give us no comfort.
And the heart that was led astray
by the customs of this mundane era,
finally stumbles on the entrance
to your heart, its refuge, and is revived
after hearing words from your mouth.
He says that in the depths of his soul
he has long conversations with his God,
taking great care not to say anything
which could be a heresy; he insists that both
are theologians, but they have to speak
in parables; there is no one who can quote
them exactly, and with all these obscure
words the poor fellow is severely criticized
by philologists. And he responds:
To speak with God is to descend into
the abyss; no matter how deep you go
you never reach Him; I examine everything
and express my feelings, but God is hidden,
and of God, there is really nothing I can say.
White lamb of the Lord, you take away
the sins of the world and you staunch
the blood of Cain which flows from
your pierced side; the divine whiteness
of your body is gentleness, the light
from the beacon of your faithful heart
burns with acceptance: you are the lamp
which illuminates the City of God.
The tears of your mother flowed over
your cold body and frosted the earth;
like the dew that covers the white fleece
of the lamb with frost on a cold night,
like the dew on the fleece which Gideon
laid on the threshing floor after
he asked for a sign from God.
The fleece, like that which the Argonauts
were seeking in the most remote and
distant seas, is given to us by your hands
soaked in the blood of your veins;
and it is the true golden fleece
that never fades and which no robber
can ever steal; the pure gold of your blood
without flaw which, with the fire
of love, became the light of the Sun!
Like the path of the golden road
to Santiago in the nighttime sky
a dusting of starsa radiant crown
of thorns covers your forehead
with light. Our sins are the thorns
casting a halo of light around the jet black
shadow of your head. Our sins create
sparks of sunlight on the temples
of the Word, the womb of our souls,
flesh that hears, sees, touches and feels.
The Glory of the Lord shines
into our souls from the radiant circle
of your diadem, the only ornament
that adorns you, and though we are daunted,
we are enlightened by it. You are covered by
the random furrows of the heavenly plowshare
of your piercing crown; the thorns
wound you gently, and in return
you made them immortal in the eyes
of the faithful, for whom they sparkle
with the springtime of eternal youth,
like the memory of grandfathers filled with
the fervent desire for future grandchildren.
From the fruit of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil that will someday make us gods,
the red juice seeps out between the thorns.
Oh, blessed guilt, the essential knowledge
knowledge that leads to self reproach
the source of redemption; fertile guilt,
you made the Word flesh, that is, consciousness:
flesh that touches and feels, that listens and sees!
Your body is a haven where the light
of the centuries is gatheredan eternity!
where the fleeting hours are resting.
Your heart (the hourglass of life) stopped beating
after giving its blood, and today it measures
eternity, the timeless moment of love.
Time elapses in You, in your heart:
yesterday and tomorrow are the same;
the beginning and the end are one.
Your body, crown of the intimate
fabric of the Universe, is its exemplar;
an immense region where men
harbor the anxious hope that they will
never die completely. You are the trunk
of humanity; you are the vine
whose branches here on earth are those
who, without realizing it, labor
and struggle to find You. You, the Man,
King of the Universe! Under the white
mantle of your flesh, naked and regal,
we see the bones of your body,
the fabric of the world; the support,
shape, and proportion of all that is. Death
has not broken your bones; the stones
of the tower, the foundation on which
Creation, the dwelling of God, is resting!
Is not the redness of that vast, glowing
rosary of constellations, your skeleton?
Be silent, dear heart; yours are sorrows
that should not be expressed; let them fester
in your bosom, and if something saddens you
do not let it be something that disturbs
anothers peace of mind with the bitterness
of an untimely outburst. Your complaint is
a product of your ego because it is only
a reflection of your vanity. Yours is the pain
which is common to all human beings;
look for the intimate bond that is found in
brotherhood linking you with your brother;
it enlarges and does not belittle your mind;
flesh which is separated never has meaning;
only our common pain can sanctify us.
From the framework of the cross
the accusing finger of your right hand
points to what is written in the eternal
book of life. Just one time, You, Jesus,
the Word, wrote on the ground, in the dust
where those of us made of clay tread,
and not with pen nor ink, but with the same
finger that anointed the blind mans eyes
and healed him. It was morning,
and as you did it, you humbled yourself
by bending down. And the finger that wrote
was the same finger of God with which
You cast out demons.
So that in the soft dust
we might read the lesson of conscience
that your finger wrote as you bowed
over the earth, which is your open book,
both living and sacred! As you wrote in it,
to demonstrate the humble task of the writer,
by humbling yourself.
The adulteress,
her eyes on the ground which was bathed
with the tears of her sorrow, was walking alone
with her arms crossed over her breast,
holding in it the gift of your forgiveness,
like a mother holds a child who has
just been born.
May my new pen inscribe
on the soil of my homeland
the forgiveness which your lesson teaches us!
Our fear of the Lord comes from
the knowledge of darkness; but our faith
in You, Jesus, Light of Life, is the culmination
of that knowledge. On the rugged peak
of Mount Sinai, your Father was wrapped
in a thick cloud, with a burst of lightning
the mountain quaked like a smoldering furnace
I am who I am! He shouted, giving the people
the list of commandments to define sins.
But You are on the humble Mount of Calvary,
a gentle hill covered by sorrow and by blood,
the belly of your homeland which, pregnant with
unfathomable grief, would give birth to the cross;
naked, under a cloudless sun, you silently
give us a redeeming message, saying:
I am the vine, you are the branches!
After nurturing death, and imbuing
your love with your sacred humanity,
a gentle feeling of peace begins to flow
into the depths of our soul like a river of milk.
We no longer fear the Lord, your Father,
and a Calvary of love as bright as the sun
hides the clouds of Sinai, showing us
the smile of heaven, which is the nest
where our hopes will find refuge.
You were wrapped in swaddling cloths
at birth. The shepherds came and You,
the Life, were lying on the bed of the manger
when the heavenly host proclaimed: Glory to God
in the highest; but now, when you are naked
on the bed of the cross, you dazzle the Sun
which is extinguished by your splendor,
Moon of God, and the earth sympathizes
with your silence. Because in You is the Life
which is the light of men, and when you died
they were in darkness; but your death
was a burning darkness; it was the darkness
of a blazing love, in which the light
of resurrection was shining. Your death was
the crown and the fulfillment of your
obedience, which let you become flesh.
I am the handmaid of the Lord your mother
said submissively, and let it be to me according
to your word; and in response to her obedience
to the Father, the Word which is Life,
cast its light on all living beings
and wrapped its flesh in swaddling cloths.
And when that Word faced death, it said:
Not my will, but thine, be done!;
and when You were naked, oh Moon of Spirit,
the eternal darkness was unclothed.
Your naked body is the Word,
pure spiritual milk without disguise,
since there can be none in a naked body.
You should not be ashamed to appear
naked before your Father. Adam fled
from the Lord in fear when he realized
he was naked. In the mirror of his
nakedness he saw his transgression.
When their sin opened their eyes,
they saw their nakedness and made
aprons by sewing fig leaves together.
When God called, Adam where are you,
Adam was not able to hide his fear;
but we know how to hide it completely
behind your innocent nakedness. Its light
removes the stain of our sin, which is
erased by its whiteness. You returned
naked to the Father, just as You left Him;
your movements are controlled by laws
of the spirit, and your body without stain
is the Life. You let the soldiers who put
you on the cross divide your garments:
they will wear your clothes, but not
your nakedness, which is our salvation.
And like a flower of nakedness
your thick Nazarene hair covers your
head like a crown! Put on
your nakedness, Lord, conqueror
of our death, and may the Life redeem
all that is still mortal within us!
At night the full moon tells us
that the sun is shining beneath the earth:
and your light is similar: You are
the proof of God, and in our night
only You can reveal the Father Eternal:
only your lunar light in our dark night
tells us the Sun in shining. As it reflects,
the darkness has an even greater and brighter
brilliancy since, like well-polished marble,
the blacker it is the more it reflects.
God is the darkness around you from which
the light emerges; except when your breast,
its mirror, is hidden. You reveal the mystery
of Divinity set within the darkness
of night, its white blood of
reflected light; because You, the Man,
possessed a body where the spiritual light,
which is darkness for the physical human
eye, is embodied by love.
Lord, you became God for our sake.
As a tribute to humanity, you have blended
your blood, yours and ours, with the light
from the eternal and infinite dark night,
with the essence of divinity. It is a wound
that revealed the light, tearing open the darkness
of God, your Father, the burning sun that shines
through your breast lacerated by a scalding love.
And you encompass the infinity of God
within the sacred temple of your body,
and you fashion eternity with your sighs,
a rosary of pain. Your breast shows us
the white eternity which awaits us,
and in your shining mirror the anxious soul
can see its origin from before this life.
Your humanity reveals the light that is
hidden within the darkness of God
and is a mirror of God.
Your body
is like the dawn, like the dawn after it
drops the black cloak of night, leaving
it coiled around its feet. With your arms
outstretched in a generous gesture
that uncovers your body and offers it
to all who suffer the need for love,
you remove the curtain of darkness
from the terrible state of mystery
which has tormented the race of Adam
throughout the passage of the centuries;
with your outstretched arms you tear open
and push back the black abyss of God,
your Father, and you hang the shroud
which covered you on your cross,
leaving you naked. When you died,
the curtain of the temple was rent,
the earth shook, the tombs were opened,
and the saints who were resting
rose up to see your white body
which in its nakedness is a naked image
of the Father. You revealed to us
the humanity of God; with your two arms
which unfastened the cloak of mystery,
you revealed to us the divine essence,
the humanity of God, which also shows us
the divinity of man. In your body (which is
the holy church) it is in God, your Father,
that we live and move and have our being,
as your brothers in the divine family.
And you embody the darkness, enclosing
the shadowy essences within the confines
of your body (the matrix of our race)
because your white body is the shining
cloak of the immense divine obscurity!
Don Juan with ideas that entertain
all possible theories, wanton pursuer
of thought, eternal pilgrim anxious
to know it all, I know you complain of
boredom after your quest and advise
other young men to abandon the path
of knowledge and enclose their destiny
behind a sacred barrier of ignorance.
It was never the love of truth, but
an intellectual lust that controlled
your mind and gave you that urge
to pursue reason so violently;
but she has punished this offence
by making your thinking sterile.
Your body which is white like the Host
has become the Gospel for men.
The Hellenic Gods in the pink clouds
of Olympus offered their bodies
as a classic example of beauty,
a joy of life that has passed away;
but only You, the flesh which suffers,
the hurting flesh which bleeds,
could give to us mortals, as food
for the heart, the bread of immortality.
You are the Man-God, the Son of Man!
Humanity suffered the painful birth
of a death which was the salvation of life,
bringing your light as the Light of our night;
this is the man of God during our night,
and manhood is His divine humanity.
You are the Man, the Reason, the Norm;
your cross is our staff, the measure
of pain which purifies and is the support
of our righteousness: it lifts up
the heart of the man who has fallen.
You have humanized the universe, Christ.
Behold the Man! through whom God is real.
I have no Man! we say in moments of   John 5:7.
mortal anguish; but you answer:
So great is the Man, the King of those
who are outcast, of the Holy Church,
of those who are homeless, who cross
the mortal desert looking for the true
meaning of the eternal, which is the cross!...
The black angel brushes my heart
with his wings, pulling me out of a dream
in which I am flying on a mad dash
through the sky on the back of Clavileño.
As I fall my poor forehead is hit by
the shock of an intractable truth,
as hard and unchangeable as a rock,
serving as a cruel lesson to our efforts.
Then, immersed in this bad mood,
the truth makes me hate my life, and I
begin to feel very frightened of myself;
but then you look at me with sympathy,
and your eyes bring back to me the magic
of the dream in which the truth is forgotten.
Rest, dear heart, you have struggled enough
and during this respite the final rest
which is eternal is waiting; be satisfied
with what you have already won during
the battle, and now that you are resting
from the struggle, purge yourself from the taste
of that bad blood you acquired
on the burning sands of the battlefield.
Now, poor combatant, go to God peacefully,
and since it is the struggle that defiles us,
wrap yourself in the calmness of total
resignation; then you will breathe
the divine air that enlarges you until you
become one with the Heart of the World.
Matthew gave it a human head,
Luke the torso of a bull, Mark the claws
of a lion and John wings like those
of an eagle. It was born on a morning
of dense fog when pure light
streamed out of God over hills
and valleys, though it was veiled by a mist
that made some sick but others were healed.
Because it is the incarnation of that angel
who in heaven bears the name of Sphinx,
who amid the splendor of golden clouds
seems to be the God of love and wrath,
and the light of mystery rises up but never
touches the One who is hidden within it.
It was a flower torn from the tree by hail
and then a husk on the ground under the sun;
it rolled in the dust through the stubble
at the mercy of the changing wind.
The withered flower became humus
hidden underneath a prickly furze bush,
and during the course of a red sunset
was buried by a lowly worm. Out of this spell
arose a perfume which strives to reach
immortal heaven, a temple of calm
where there is neither hail nor falseness;
the body is more than just a container
of the mind; for the song it is a lyre,
and it is the purpose of life to become a soul.
The black lily of the monastery garden,
the one that used to know your anguish,
has lost its bloom since it is no longer watered,
either by the scholastic sweat of your brow
or the tears from your ecclesiastical eyes,
ever since you saw that red mantle
under which your ambition loosened
the cord that you had kept so flexible.
Beneath the prayers and the whispers
of the refectory the breeze brings the sound
of the Tempters laughter to the black lily
of the garden. And to its fateful murmur,
as if he were hearing mass, the black lily
contritely bends down to pick up its bud.
The sea, a trembling mirror for the eyes
of the Lord, the first cradle of life;
the sea, always bare and breathless
over His blue brow, with no human trace,
moments after the first kiss of the Creator
the sea whose white tongues touch
the foot of Mount Carmel in Palestine;
it filled your final dream with its canticle
a question without an answerlike
the first dream of Adam, shortly after
his new flesh was kneaded and he awoke
to find an unclothed woman smiling at him.
The sea mourned your sad death,
scattering tears over its waves,
while your heart (an ocean of compassion)
became as still as the earth. It asked for
your cross so it could carry this man
beyond our two columns of Hercules,
where the Southern Cross appeared
in the sky, and around it it wrapped
a necklace of pearls from your blood
taken from the neck of your mother.
Why? roared the sea; but when it saw
your Father place the crosshis head
above the heavens and on it the man,
the cause of creation, the sea became calm
like a shepherd who caresses and feeds
the mastiff with his munificent hand.
What has been written, is written! said Pilate
as he placed the words above your head.
And You, the Word, are speaking with your death
without making a sound, and in dark silence
you express the whiteness of your life
with a light that never ends. Your light
falls over us silently, bit by bit,
like white snowflakes that settle
on the green grass; your blood falls
on us drop by drop; it flows endlessly
and it permeates our soul. Like the grass,
humbly, with hands relaxed, and minds
at rest, with our hearts beating like a silent
white-tailed deer, we receive the snowfall
of your light. Although the rays of your light
are dormant, they penetrate our eyelids,
and those rays of light illumine our dreams.
The light that surrounds you is the Spirit
flowing out of your Father, the eternal Sun;
it penetrates the darkness and flows into us
from You, His moon, in our sad night.
Darkness was upon the face of the deep and
the Spirit of God moved over the dark waters
when He Who Is commanded: Let there be light!;
and from the heart of that darkness came
the Spirit-Light, which fills our hearts
with the image of your face, a living replica
of the One in whose image we are made,
and in whose image You cast the light on us.
And that light is the love which unites us;
it unites us and forms the divine humanity
of your universal church in our hearts.
The light, a diamond in the waters flowing
from heaven above, clothes your nakedness;
when the darkness touches your body
it assumes the whiteness of intense light!
The stillness clutched,  with robust hand,
the poor restless dog,
and forever
faithful it lay to rest in its motherly
pious land.
Its gentle eyes
will not fix themselves on mine
with mute sadness;
will not lick my hand
nor in my lap will its slender head
repose.
And now: of what do you dream?
Where has your submissive spirit gone?
Is there no other world
in which you will revive, my poor beast,
and above the heavens
Ill walk you trotting by my side?
The other world!
Other... other and not this!
A world without the dog,
no soft mountains,
no serene rivers
flanked by the serene trees,
no birds or flowers,
no dogs, or horses,
no oxen that plough...
World of the spirits!
But, there,  we will not have
the souls of the living things
around our soul,
the soul of the fields,
the souls of the rocks,
the souls of the trees and the rivers,
of the beasts?
Over there, in the other world,
your soul, poor dog.
Will it not have to repose its spiritual head
in my spiritual lap?
The tongue of your soul, poor friend,
will it not lick the hand of my soul?
The other world... !
Other... and not this!
Oh, you will never be back, my poor dog,
to submerge your eyes
in the eyes that were your mandate;
see, the land rips you up
from he who was your ideal, your god, your glory.
But he, your sad lord,
will he have you in the other life?
The other world...?
The other world is the one of pure spirit!
Of the pure spirit!
Oh, terrible purity,
inanity, empty!
Will I never see you again, gentle friend?
There, will you be a memory,
pure memory?
And this memory:
will it not run before my eyes?
Will it not leap, yielding unto happiness,
pricking up the tail?
Will it not lick the hand of my spirit?
Will it not gaze into my eyes?
This memory:
will you not be you, you yourself,
lord of yourself, living eternal life?
Your dreams: what were they made of?
What of the piety with which you followed loyally
the mandate of my voice?
I was your religion, I was your glory;
you dreamed of God in me;
my eyes were a window for you
from the other world.
If you knew, my dog,
how sad your god is because you have died.
Your god will also die one day!
You died with your eyes
on my eyes fixed,
perhaps searching in these eyes for the mystery
that enshrouded you.
And your pupils, sad
to spy my induring desires,
seemed to ask:
Where are we going my lord?
Where are we going?
Life with man, poor beast,
has given you perhaps a dark longing
that the wolf knows not;
perhaps when you lay the head
in my lap
you vaguely dreamed of being a man
after death!
To be man, poor beast!
Look, my poor friend,
my faithful believer;
to see your eyes that watch me die,
to see your gaze crystallising,
once fluid,
I also ask you: Where are we going?
To be man, poor dog!
Look, your brother
is this other poor dog,
spread eagled by the tomb of your god,
howling at the heavens,
calls on death!
You have died in gentleness,
you with sweetness,
giving yourself up to me in the supreme
submission of life;
but he, he who whimpers
alongside the tomb of his god, of his lord,
neither dying knows.
You, on dying, vaguely sensed
life in my memory,
to not die completely,
but your poor brother
is seen as already dead in life,
is seen to be lost
and howls at the sky begging for death.
Rest in peace, my poor comrade,
rest in peace; sadder
the fortune of your god that is not yours.
The gods weep,
the gods weep when the dog dies
that licked their hands,
that watched their eyes,
and on seeing them thus asked:
Na mão de Deus, na sua mão direita.
Anthero de Quental. Sonnet.
Lord, when you bless us with the kiss
which stops our breath, your kiss of death,
our heart is weighed down by the heavy
pressure of your strong right hand.
And in your left hand, oppressed
by its weight, our head returns
to its eternal sleep, still struggling
to reach you as its anxiety is quenched.
Place my heart on your breast,
as though it were resting in a cradle
far from the stormy sea of passions,
while my mind, free from the weight
of thought—the source of illusions—
sleeps in the sun in your powerful hand.
Your cross is the loom which weaves
the cloth of human sorrows, woven
by the divine plan with the history
of our poor people who are governed by
the trials and tribulations of destiny.
And this human cloth is the idea
of Ideas, of the divine Word,
the revelation of God who knows Himself
through letting Himself be known. The thought
of God is our history that is woven
by the loom of your cross, oh Christ!;
and through this process, the infinite
variations of life, with the woolen
yarn from the bobbinthe soulwe knit
the limitless cloth of your mantle.
While he slept in Haranwith a stone
for a pillowJacob dreamed of a ladder
where angels were ascending and descending;
this ladder was your cross: above it
the voice of your God tells us: I am with you!
I will keep you and bring you back to this land!
Your cross provides the steps which lead to Glory
and it is the strong staff with which the man
of faith can move the mountains
of the universe; and it is the point
of support for the heart; it is crystallized
like a diamond in the furnace of love.
Your cross is a winnowing-fork that divides
your harvest so the wheat goes to the granary
and the straw is blown by the wind into the fire
which constantly purifies the chaff.
Your body like a sword that shines in the sun;
your body like a sword that sparkles in the sun,
a sword of the Lord, covered with blood,
like the knife with which the scaly skin
of the Leviathan was cut away;
like a sword that wins battles
your word is a two-edged sword!.
which is used to sever the earthly cord
of our life. Since You came
to bring us peace by means of war:
because of You there is war between parent
and child; between brothers, husband and wife:
you are the sword of peace that wounds
in order to put an end to war with war;
you are the steel that divides and unites,
since only that which divides can unite;
and you are the sword that burns, pure fire,
like the flaming sword of the cherubim
who guards the path to the tree of life
in paradise. And you are the white flame
in the blazing fire, the crucible of our souls,
that dissolves our pain and transmutes it
into a river leading to the sun, an ocean of fire.
A white flash, a lightning bolt which is blood
from the darkness, like the one which
struck Saul on the road to Damascus,
asking him, why do you persecute me, Saul!
I am Jesus whom you persecute, Saul.
White flame of fire which devours,
a blaze of love: like the dry tinder
that burns my entire heart;
my sinful flesh is consumed,
and its glowing sparks become embers!
The love for your white body burns us;
love which is hunger, love from the heart;
it is hunger for the creative Word
that became flesh; a fierce love of life
that is not satisfied with embraces, kisses,
nor with any conjugal union.
Only partaking of you eases our longing,
bread of immortality, divine flesh.
Our overwhelming love becomes hunger,
oh, Lamb of God!; it longs to partake of You;
it longs to know the taste of your spirit,
to partake of your heart and let it soothe
the burning of our dry tongue:
it is not to enjoy You, but to make you ours,
flesh of our flesh, and to feel your sorrow
so that we can experience death in life.
With your arms wide open in a gesture
of loving acceptance, you say to us:
Come, take, eat: this is my body!
You are the flesh of God, the Word Incarnate,
the incarnation of our divine hunger for You!
It is not faith but willpower that moves
mountains from one place to another,
but in the former there is understanding
and in our own mind it becomes enormous.
To wish, to believe, to act—is the sacred
progression that gives strength to our efforts;
between the wish and the intention faith
creates a bond which gives luster to the hero.
Let it be understood, it matters not if it is
faith which is pure, free, vital or burning
which destroys and creates our actions;
the mental state of Saturn devours
the dogma that created this idea;
faith in faith itself, a never-ending dawn!
Your forehead is the arch of the basilica
which is your body, and it is bronzed
by the warm sun; under the wide open sky
it nurtured your heavenly thoughts
which sprouted like wild flowers
pink carnations, daisies, poppies...
that would then have seeds to grow
new flowers, in a new springtime;
and not pearls, but shining pebbles,
solid and plain which, once they are cut,
the lapidary strings as an ornament.
Paradoxes, parables and apologues
flow freely from your mouth;
not syllogism, nor bits of logic
which bind the mind like a collar.
You came to cast fire upon the earth;
You are fire, a white light that rains down.
Tongues of fire descended on each of your
apostlesYou in Gloryand they were tongues
of the Word that became Man in the vault
of the heavens; of the cold, luminous body
that is nourished by fish, by a silent fish,
a creature from the waters of the deep,
which builds his nest below the storms.
You are a fire that rises to the heavens
in search of the Sun, your Father Eternal;
a fire that ignites our blood and purifies
the rotten core of sin, of the fruit from
the tree of knowledge, which is your blood,
Seraph of Pain, on the cross of fire;
you are the Seraph, the burning coal
of love, the rose from the tree of the cross.
Two black wings envelop your head;
your feet are a pair of wings that soar
from Mount Tabor to the Mount of Calvary;
and with arms like wings of fire that rend
the darkness, You return to your Father.
And the wood of your cross vibrates
with the mystical sound of your flight!
Your shoulders are sun drenched hills
where, in the shade of your hair
perfumed foliageand under its shelter,
the sheep from your Fathers herd
take their rest; rounded white hillocks,
a place to lie down and feast our eyes
on the valley of your breast,
crowned by an infinity of living things
and creating in us a tormented soul
as we sleep in the shadow of Spirit;
surrounded by sand dunes, the soul
is smothered by the whispering foam
from the dark sea (which is your Father)
where we float while clinging to You!
White Host from the wheat that grows
in the desert, ground by the tooth
of pain that crushes; divine bread
of wheat flour, as white as milk,
Host, you are the Son of the black earth;
you are the Son of earth, the Son of Man,
the Son of God and the Virgin Mother,
our mother, the earth. We mortals
wander through the earth like stalks of corn
until the sickle of death harvests us;
the harrow converts what was yesterday
a field for sports into a threshing floor;
we go into the hopper, and from that flour
God kneads His bread which lives as men,
the one bread which is us, your disciples.
It lives in You, Host white as milk,
born of the Virgin Mother Earth;
through you God is one with His mortals;
earth and water of God are bread and wine
of men, and through them God becomes man.
Your cross was like a bowl in which
the hands of your Father kneaded our bread.
When shades of night have come
And all my house is sleeping,
The silent peace of home
Its arms about them keeping,
And the only sound I hear
Is my children's measured breathing,—
Then my dream sees life appear
Toward a larger meaning wreathing;
Then their breathing seems a prayer
Through their voice of dream repeating,
While their consciousness is bare
In their God the Father meeting.
Dream, O Dream, thou art the sign
Of the life that knows no ending,
Of that stainless life divine
On this present life attending!
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God;
convert it for me, oh Christ, into a clear pool
into which a delightful shower of faith
may fall. I will be content if am able
to sip only a tiny drop of those waters
without being able to immerse myself in the sea,
since He says: whoever sees my face will die,
and I need that drop so that I can live.
I am wounded by the merciless light
of knowledge that does not quench my thirst;
I do not drink the living water, but I sweat
and I am poisoned by the sweat of doubt;
save me, oh Christ, from this mute spirit,
I believe, help thou my unbelief.
Sturdy Iberian Jesus, you who Teresa
loved and who dies in the secret depths
of the soul, fulfill the promise you gave
in response to the faith of your beloved.
Like a divine Don Quijote, she felt
a beautiful pain that she bequeathed
to our immortal Spain, whose motto is:
only the eternal exists; God or nothing!
If He became human to make us gods,
becoming mortal to free us from death,
what more can you do, bold heart, who dares
to break the chains of human destiny
and who in this cruel life do not rest,
struggling endlessly to find yourself?
No, I will never give up because my lot
is to struggle without hoping for a victory
and to succumb in search of Glory,
after setbacks like those of Don Quijote.
As long as this stubborn desire lasts
I will continue the absurd, the illusory belief
that gives life, and I will not walk with the sad
resignation of the slave who is confined
to a treadmill. Because that type of
thought fills our spirit with a shudder
of desperation; it destroys our
will to live and takes away our hunger
to escape death; it parches our existence
and uproots its immortal foundation.
On reading Cournot.
There is a law of miracles which controls
all that evades the other laws since not even God,
with His omnipotence, is free from the abyss
in which all that is irrational disappears.
This law of life is not formulated
with a plan or with arithmetical numbers,
but the mind is aware of it from birth
and disguises it with the name of chance.
God spins with both hands on His loom;
the left hand makes a clear design
that mans understanding is able to grasp,
while on this canvas the right hand
embroiders the sacred whim of chance,
which is the powerful arm of progress.
Poem of the Cid, lines 352-356.
Here is the mouth which the spear opened
so you might speak of your passion with blood;
the other was closed. Longinus was so blind
that he did not see: he stabbed you in the side
so that the blood flowed out, and it ran
down the shaft until both of his hands
were coated with it; he raised them
and covered his face; he opened his eyes,
he looked around, he believed in You and was saved.
This ruby was a vein of fire that warmed
the amber of your breast until it ignited
the fire of your passion; a breath of air,
a fountain where the soul who is lost in the
desert can quench its thirst for God
a shower of Love from the living God
that can soften even the hardest heart.
Hear my prayer, oh non-existent God,
and in your nothingness accept my protests,
You who never leave us without the comfort
of deception. You offer no resistance
to our prayers and you have seen our longing.
The farther you distance yourself from my mind
the more I remember those pleasant fables
which comforted my soul on sad nights.
How great you are, my God! You are so great
you are only an Idea; and no matter how much
we broaden it, our reality is never wide enough
to encompass you. I suffer because of you,
non-existent God, because if you were to exist
then I too would truly exist.
The key to Being: in the beginning was the Word
through which all that is made was made
and the Word is the link which God uses
to connect the separate parts of His creation.
Because of this man ceases to be a slave
and is able to use it in his rigorous battle;
it allows him to rest when his soul sweats
like a deer by a fountain after he is pursued.
Hallowed be the name of God
which is also God, since it was with the Word
that He created the world in the beginning.
With the Word, like God, man
labors to forge the reality of his ideas:
never profane it with idle thoughts.
My language is the lifeblood of my spirit
and my country is wherever its sovereign word
is spoken, because nothing diminishes its voice
no matter how much it encompasses both worlds.
Seneca heralded it even before its birth
and he enclosed it in his austere Latin;
with it Alfonso gave life to Europe and
Columbus increased the size of the earth.
This language of mine floats like the vessel
of a hundred different and faraway races,
and from it blossoms the flower of national heroes
like Juárez and Rizal; then, embracing
a legion of peoples, it was the language in which
God gave Cervantes the Gospel of Don Quijote.
Vorrei voler, Signor, quel ch'io non voglio
Michelangelo
God, I would like to wish for what I dont want;
to merge with You and loose my self,
this terrible ego that kills me
and disrupts the world around me.
If your right hand abandons me,
what will become of me? I will be
a prisoner of myself; man can never
escape his nothingness, so I expect nothing.
Father, may your will be done!; I say this
at the beginning and the end of each day,
trying to adapt myself to your commandment,
but inside me resonates the voice
of the ageless Lucifer, who I would, in truth,
want to become, a grave disobedience!
Just hearing it rain and feeling Im alive;
the entire universe is converted into mist
and my consciousness is filled with haze
as I hear the raindrops slowly falling.
Inside me all that is active has died
while my vision is blurred by the rain,
and down there is a dish where water
drips from the hourglass and the archive
of memory with silent recollections;
my spirit is filled with pure inertia;
without a lance and therefore no shield,
at the mercy of the winds of fate.
This life, which is bare existence,
is it not, perhaps, the life within death?
Master, are you dead, or are you
calmly sleeping the sleep of the just?
For three days your death was a reverie,
a dream much longer than your others;
Christ, you dreamed the dreams of Man,
while your heart stayed awake. An angel
gently placed that blessing of human
calmness on your brow, that precursor
of the final rest from this drudgery;
the soft, black wings of the angel
formed a canopy of silence and forgetfulness
over your eyes; the soil of our
mother earth was your bed; at your side,
meditating on itself with arms crossed,
was the Word. Tell us, were you dreaming?
Were you dreaming of your Fathers kingdom?
Was your life a dream like ours,
perhaps? In the quiet center of your soul
was there an exact copy of our Fathers
dream of life? Tell us, Brother, what else
could our life be but a dream of your life?
Is that not what our faith makes us want,
nothing more than the dream of your
works, Christ! You made the heavens,
a cluster of stars of good fortune;
for us you created the night of the soul
like a sumptuous mantle of endless illusion!
Because of you, the arms of the Lord
rock us with the motion of the heavens
and in the silence of the night He adorns
the sky with a sprinkle of lights.
So your dream is the peace that brings war,
and your life, the war that brings peace!
Oh soul without a home, wandering soul
that sleeps under the roof of an open sky,
stumbling blindly down the path of fate
while sustained by the faith of a blind hope.
That sky, your origin, which gives
no peace or repose, offers you a sunset
of towering red clouds that finally brings
you a cup that will satisfy your thirst.
One night, while stopping at a hermitage,
you lay down to sleep; from the blessed
smile of the Virgin of the Roads a divine
dream appeared before your eyes,
and this dream is the star on which
the story of your final destiny is written.
"I give you my peace", said the one who told us:
"I come not to bring peace, but a sword";
the Son died in peace on the cross
and left us on earth enveloped in wars.
"I give you my peace", an inner peace,
a profound calm below the storm;
and this peace, dear Jesus, where can I find it?
Where can I hide the treasure of my love?
Jesus, the war you brought goes on,
and the peace you left us has been lost;
your peace, gentle rabbi, what good is it
now that for us you have closed serene Olympus?
"Father, forgive them for they know not
what they are doing, and trusting in you,
they keep on doing what they did before
you came, and they have become unhappy.
"Today you will be with me in my Father's
house", and His meaning has been confused
so that any criminal who dies thinks
he is following the path that leads to virtue.
"I am thirsty", and you arose to the fountain
of happiness, dear Jesus, but here on earth
we are dying of thirst, and in the muck
the water sent from heaven is full of mud.
"Woman here is your son; here is your mother",
was your admonishment to Mary and to John;
tell us where that leaves us; where is the Father
in whose image you saw yourself?
"My God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
And why, Jesus, have you abandoned us?
See how we are left to go on aimlessly
like a flock of sheep without a shepherd.
"Into your hands I commit my spirit!"
and your respite was filled with glory,
but without it, down here we your brothers
fill our history with blood and tears.
"It is finished", was your cry as you died;
this is the way your work ended, Sublime Master;
today our voice is lost in the infinite;
and now, dear Jesus, who will redeem us?
As white as the milk of Mary,
the cream of Humanity, pure food
that gives peace to the body. Because milk is
the white flower of love from the mothers
womb, love that is given as sustenance.
In her womb, God engendered you with
Wisdom that is human and is virgin,
and with her milk you were nourished; you grew
in strength, in knowledge and in grace,
staying in the wilderness until the day
of your manifestation to Israel, when you
emerged from the waters of the Jordan.
White lion of the deserts, winds
of fire ruffle your black hair while
your fathers sun shines on you, and you
watch us in the sand. You pursue the one
you love with intense affection, and if he flees
you follow him relentlessly, ensnaring him
without mercy; he is dying of thirst
and is afraid to stop and drink in the arroyos
under the gaze of your threatening eyes
in pursuit of victims. Fearing what he desires,
he hears you panting behind
the rocks, and when he finally surrenders,
awaiting your claws with closed eyes,
his heart stopped, his face frozen,
he feels your blood that quenches thirst,
he feels the embrace of a sweet death
that returns him to the life he was fleeing,
and thus to eat you is to be eaten by you,
King of the desert, Lion of Judah!
Lily of the valley of pain, sprinkled
with the sweat and tears of Adam;
white lily among the thistles, like a cup
you collect the dew from heaven
and convert it into wine for us. Longing
to be the mother of God, Humanity wanted
you to be born on earth, in the same way that
Rachel pleaded with Jacob, shouting loudly:
Give me a child from you, or else I shall die!
And becoming a mother, Rachel died happily,
giving thanks to heaven after giving birth
to the child, whose name was Benjamin.
And on the road to Bethlehem Jacob
set up a pillar on Rachels tomb so that
the bones of the sacrum which carried
Benjamin would tremble with love
in the dust, upon hearing the echo of
her moans which shook the earth.
Your nails are the keys which unlock
the door of death, and of life.
They are the four eyeteeth of Death
forged by Tubal-cain the Cainite
with the art he used to build
the primitive houses of a city which
he founded after covering it with blood,
(as a foundation); the son of the first man
took his brothers lifeand war began!
from which art originated and was sanctified
by your hands, Master Carpenter!
Yours were already calloused in youth
by the difficult task of pounding nails
as you sweated over the wood
that of your cross, a wedding bed, an omen
each day earning for yourself a crust
of bread, which teaches us to earn it
by praying to your Father every day.
Your hands liberated the art taken from
the tree of knowledge of good and evil
and given to Cain, the first child of Adam,
his father. And these hands, always open,
finally achieved human diligence
through the cross, the finished woodwork
made with the sweat of a divine man.
Because the cross is also a work of art
that surpasses the creations of nature.
To those of his lineage, Cain left the art
of cleverness, which is similar to the crime
of envyeven art is a crimeand You,
Lord, transformed it into something pure,
You, with your hands lifting up to heaven
the terrible fruit of knowledge!
I am the light of the world.
Naked moon that is stripped of spirit
in the starry night, our gaze
is centered on you, oh bright star
of the valley of tears! Because that is
the only way we poor men are able to
see you face to face. You are the Man,
and in your divine nakedness we see
the eternal light of the blinding Sun.
As you mirror God, it confirms
that we are men, that is: that we are gods;
and by your light, bright star of souls,
the marble statues of Greece acquired
new glow; we saw the gods of Olympus
go in search of your Father:
Homer hand in hand with Isaiah,
Socrates with Daniel, searching for mankind.
Socrates, with reason as astrolabe and compass,
discovered that humanity is the child
of God. But you, Christ, conquered
with the sword of love, which is pure fire,
oh Lion of Judah, King of the Desert!
The converted gods were baptized
and they carried out their penitence,
and they escort the people to your cross
so that from you, the eternal Man,
they could learn that they are men.
Yours are the hands that opened the eyes
of the blind and the ears of the deaf;
they raised the daughter of Jairus;
and with a loving touch like a gentle
breeze they caressed the unbound hair
of the children; they gave out the bread,
which was your body, as you bade goodbye
to the wedding feast; now like two fountains
they ooze blood. It falls over the eyes
of those who see, and over the ears
of those who hear; over the hair
of the children as well. And blood rains
on the earth from the Christs pierced
hands, falling on the hands of those
who, then and now, raise them to beg
God to give back their miserable life.
And with your hands You seize the nails
and manage the oars of your cross!
Princess, I have absorbed your tears
and in them the secret of your heart,
but never fear, I swear it by your bed,
my tongue will not say it was captivated
by your mouth. I keep my promises.
When I was wretched and abandoned
and I sought refuge under your roof,
you sat me next to you at your table.
And not only there. But really, madam,
no matter how thin are the threads
woven into this redeeming custom,
this is still the foundation of our life,
and one eats at a pre-established hour,
more for killing time than because of hunger.
With insolent hands they crushed
the vital redness of your cheeks
until it faded away; the salt from your
tears burned them, and its film cast
a shadow over your eyes, saddened
by what they saw. But it troubled you
to be slapped by those uncouth
creatures from the bowels of the earth,
whose cold blood was never warmed
by the light of the sun: heartless
savages who know not what they do;
wallowing in the mad intoxication
of their cruel game, they trample flowers
while scorning the light; corrupted souls
who were oblivious to your gentleness,
a vile rabble of bloated scoundrels.
The roses of your face were playthings
for the brutal enjoyment of those animals,
monstrosities of darkness who laughed at
the Man, brazenly mocking Him
with jeers. Mirthless laughter that created
a ruddiness of humiliation spreading
between the pair of your two lips
and the pair of your two eyes; the distressing
laughter of the beast who neighs at the man!
Your innocent Nazarene hair descends
over your shoulders like a waterfall
gushing with life, these abundant
locks of dark hair that were never touched
by a razor. You were consecrated to
your Father in the womb of your Mother,
a new Samson, and this dense head
of hair is a symbol of your strength,
like the faithful who, in living locks of hair,
recline against your breast. Breezes from
the peak of Mount Tabor ruffle your hair,
and like the ripe fruit of the palm tree,
it was warmed by the sun which shone
over the pale dust of Judea.
In the River Jordan, John bathed it with
water cleansed by the sun, as it is now
bathed by your blood. Like the soft
green leaves of the weeping willow hang
over the glossy crystal of a lake
where an immaculate sky is reflected,
and the divine silence of your Fathers
sunlight is falling over your chest
that is not breathing, your hair hangs
down over your dejected brow.
Your ears are filled with prayers
coming from the sons of the earth,
and you hear angels replay memories
of the first six days in which
your Father created the world for you
and he created it with You, the Word
while You were forging your dreams
of heaven. You alone among men knew
the exact number of stars, as well as
the number of hairs on your head,
where not even one could be lost
without you knowing it. And no one
but You knows the true power of love.
In the open air your hair was covered
by the pearls of morning dew
on which the sunlight sparkled
with the arc of a celestial covenant.
During your travels, your hair became
a pillow when you rested your head
on the hard ground; foxes have a den,
birds a nest, but you, divine mendicant,
have nowhere to lay your head.
You became poor in order that we could
become rich. In the open air, your hair is
the crown of your poverty, and your strength.
Mary poured an ointment of pure nard
over it, and in this way she anointed you
for the grave, since Mary knows how
to take the good portion, and that eternal
happiness is only achieved by having You.
But like tendrils of the vine hanging down
from the heart, after the cross of sorrows
they cut down this happiness. And from
those in mourning, drops of sweat caused by
their anguish fell over the Garden of Olives,
and falling on this grieving land,
they were mixed with with the sweat
of Adam with which he, in his punishment,
had moistened the bread of his labor.
Falling down in thick locks as black
as the mysterious depths of the heavens
on an overcast night, your hair brushed
against Johns forehead like a breeze from
the underworld, when he rested his head
on your breast while saying goodbye on
the night of the Last Supper; that was when
you left us the visions of Patmos, the doctrine
of the Word that is incarnated in a man.
And now grasping the temple of death
with your two arms nailed to the cross,
you knock it to the ground, and its stones
will give us life while giving us death.
What do I care when they say Im damned
if you bless me, my heretical God;
your sacred right hand weaves my destiny
and you teach me that life is short
and death is very long. Your silence
comforts me, telling me never to stop
casting into the wind all the things
which urges others to struggle.
Lord, as long as you do not finally
ask me to reveal our secret, you know
that I will never criticize them;
it is no surprise that they anathematize me;
it is only fair that the Church may use the
Keys to the Kingdom to scratch their flees.
With their dark wings the infernal
vultures blackened the darkness following
the scent of a cadaver, and their screeches
lacerated the silence; but the flaming sword
of Michael, who was guarding the door
to Paradise, cast beams of fire forming
a shield around you and frightening
those devils away. The hapless
Archdragon, Satan the Tempter,
was furious, and he gritted his teeth
in anger after his efforts
were thwarted; slobbering spittle
and snorting blasphemous lies
about You for bringing order to chaos,
he was totally terrified by your blood;
and You, the Man elevated to God,
crushed the nape of his neck with the foot,
of your cross, always the victor!
You are the firstborn of the dead,
You are the fruit ripened by death,
from the never-ending tree of life
from which we must eat, if we wish
to avoid the final death.
Because You have made our death
the origin and the sovereign of life,
a white Death wrapped in a black mantle
and mounted on a pale horse;
Death, the Empress of History
who, once we are dead, captures
us with the greed of a conqueror.
Man is the son of God, and God the son
of Man; Christ, with your death you have
given the Universe a human attribute
and you are now the death of Death!
And centered between those closed eyes,
your nose shines like a knife; its shape
is like a ray of light plucked from
the darkness. Your final breath
passed through it, your breast quieted
and your mouth closed, after making
its final cry of life. With the last breath
rom your nostrils, the deeps congealed
n the heart of the sea. Like a ships keel,
the nose is what gives the human face
its nobility (because of its uprightness)
and it is the channel through which the air
from the heavens can reach our lungs
and keep us alive. Through it, when the sun
was screened out, you breathed the fresh air;
through it the perfumes of Mary Magdalene,
like an aromatic blessing of mercy,
blocked out the Pharisaical stench.
And when its knife was sheathed, it shows
(like a needle on the scales) your head
bowed down under the weight of death,
and above it, the counterweight of love.
Odi profanium vulgum
I will not die completely! That is what
is said by that self-centered poet who hates
common people, who challenges them
to forget him, hoping that the challenge itself
will immortalize him; it is a calculated
trick to control people and to establish
his own Glory. But the poor fellow forgets
that the one who guzzles his liquor never
completely drains it. So his time came
and he became well-known; his poetry
is still vividly alive in our memory
Alive, that is, worn out. Thinking that
he could achieve an eternal dawn, he didnt know
that even the dead will die eventually!
You are a white cloud like the one
which guided the people of God
through the desert; a cloud of whiteness
like a pearl in your black cloud
without form, the infinite shell
which is your Father. A white cloud tinged
by the blood of the sun that enters the earth
and is about to rise in another world
where His kingdom is. White like the clouds,
foam from the heavens, the celestial
fleece that pours water over the earth.
Like glistening snow is the garment
of this, your weary soul, Nazarene;
like snow; there is no launderer on earth
who could make it so white: it shines
like snow, a mirror of light. He took Peter,
James and John up on a mountain to pray
and his face was transfigured. But suddenly
another cloud casts a shadow of sadness
over his palid brow, and a soft voice
came from the cloud, saying: This is my Son,
my beloved Son, in whom I am pleased, hear him!
And the snowy whiteness of your divine body
emerges to sing among those who are dead
—it does not speak—because your body
is a divine song, and that soft canticle
—white like the music of your eyes—
like the harp of David, comforts
our souls when the evil spirit
torments them, and the harmonious
notes coming from your sacred breast
quiet the sorrows that are lodged
in the depths of our secluded
hearts. And then, the poor soul
that was tormented by the sinister
hand of the Tempter which oppresses
and makes us sad, on hearing the symphony
of your body, like a crumpled stem
that is invigorated, it straightens up
and begins to recover its purpose.
You are a song that never ends;
Lord, you are the sonorous solitude,
the epiphany of a concerto that unites
all people. Your body is a universal harp
which plays the music of the spheres.
Or is it a black cloud in the sky
that gave you the blackness of your
Nazarene hair, like a weeping willow
by the river on a moonless night?
Is it the shadow of the formless wings
of the angel of nullifying nothingness,
of Lucifer, who in his deathly descent
into the bottomless depths, placed his timeless
sorrows on your brow, on your mind? Was
the Word in You hidden by this cloud,
as black as the black wings of Lucifer,
while Love shines out, completely naked,
with only your naked chest as a veil?
Hanging with commanding simplicity
—the majesty of complete obedience—
without contortions or trembling,
like the banner of God that leads us,
through the dust of the battle
in a closed battalion. Your demeanor is one
of pure, spontaneous and noble obedience;
not like the enslaved Adam who bowed
his head to the ground with his labors,
selling his freedom to the devil
in exchange for a pittance. Upright,
like a son who freely obeys his father,
unwavering like your cross, with arms
opened wide, You show us that You have
nothing to hide, nor do You try to cover
your naked breast. You are obedient
—for obedience is the Reason—like a servant
of Love; You intervened for man, rescuing
his freedom from the claws of Satan,
giving him an awareness of the law,
since in realizing it, the one who does so
grants it to himself. Your naked body
reveals our law of divine freedom.
You, the life that lives and does not change;
You do not falter; You are; You are the Word
hanging as a standard which extends
from heaven to earth like a plumb line,
without complaint or protest. You died while
standing, like a man, not lying on the ground
like an animal; like an upright pillar.
You stand like a tower on which men
can learn to speak with a single voice:
the language of the Spirit, which praises
the glory of the Lord and clothes itself
in the flower of each nations understanding,
and yes, mother, drawing close to the ear
of our heart, it blesses us and speaks softly
in the native tongue of each person.
In You, Jesus, your lineage becomes one,
and we all are joined by your Word.
Those who survived the deluge made
bricks to construct the Tower of Babel,
but You purified your body in the fire
of love, and made of it a living diamond.
And when your tower was built there was
no sign of artistry: once its stones were hewn
they descended to You from heaven above.
While waiting for your Father, your two
bright stars of visionyour eyes like
innocent doveswere watchful; but there is
no longer any sign of regret, or subjugation
of crass desires, coming from the depths,
nothing that would create a feeling of shame
in the one who hypocritically judges another,
who sees a splinter in anothers eye, and not
the log in his own, the one who sees in You
the Devil, not a Savior or a Judge. Quivering
like vermillion dewdrops on your eyelashes,
are pearls of fire that tremble fluidly;
gazing though the veil of your eyelids
with your dark glances, You contemplate
the greenness of the earth, into whose veins
You gave your blood like a burning ember,
and your eyes examine all the corners
of our heart where you pierce us
with the thorns of your crown. Your eyes
were as blue as the blue skies; your eyes
were the bright lamps of your body,
which enabled You to become luminous,
and they gently healed all that they saw;
your pupils were blacker than a night
without a moon or stars; from out of
the darkness they glowed with a divine
luminescence; and now the white veil
of your closed eyelidsthe wings
of those white doves that always fly
toward their heavenly nesthave sealed
your gaze with a seal of blood. You forgive
by just looking. You looked at Peter
when the cock crowed, and your eyes,
so full of forgiveness, freed him of guilt!
Beautiful eyes that do not see, topaz gems
whose light has died, crystalline moons,
sad twins, you travel through the dark
spaces and are rocked by cradles
of unseen visions and omens of a world
that has come to grief. And before you
there are paths of darkness which open
and break through the fog-filled light.
Beautiful eyes that do not see, the angel
of light sees its reflection in your glow
and it sadly heaves an intangible sigh;
it raises its sightless eyes to the Castle
of God, and then with its lyre it plays
that sweet refrain of eternal love.
You, oh Christ, who keep silent to hear us,
listen to the cries arising from our hearts;
hear our supplications, the sad laments
from this veil of tears. We cry out
to You, Christ Jesus, from the abysmal
depths of our human misery,
and You, white pinnacle of Humanity,
give us the water from your snows. White
Eagle who spans the heavens as you fly,
we ask for your blood; from You, the vineyard,
wine that consoles us as it intoxicates;
from You, Moon of God, sweet light
that tells us that at night the Sun is shining
and is waiting for us; from you, stout pillar,
a place where we can rest; Sacred Host,
we ask of You the bread for our journey
to God, as an act of charity; we ask You,
Lamb of God who washes away all
the sins of the world, for the golden
fleece of your blood; we ask You
for the rose from the wild briar patch,
for the light that never dims and reveals
to us how God Is Who He Is; from You,
the vessel of divine liquor that pours
the nectar of eternity into our hearts.
We ask you, Lord, to weave our lives
into the celestial tunic of God,
using the loom of eternal life. Let us
keep the meager faith that provides a fragile
nest for our winged hopes that warble
songs of eternal life, and in your arms,
wings of the Spirit which floats over
the face of the dark waters, let us take
shelter in the shade of your brow.
Come, Lord, see how my bosom reeks;
see how I, the one you love, am suffering;
You are the resurrection and the life:
call me to Yourself, as you called Lazarus!
Be a mirror for us so that we may see
your Sun face to face and may know Him
in the same way that He knows us;
so that with our own eyes we see His light,
and so He speaks to us, face to face
and mouth to mouth, as He spoke to Moses.
Bring us your Fathers kingdom, Christ,
since the Kingdom of God is also that of Man!
Give us, Jesus, life which is a fire
that warms and enlightens, and that keeps
its wick protected within an enclosed vessel;
life that is a flame which burns eternally
and flows in ripples like those in a river.
We men deserve to die; but You,
immaculate Lamb, have died without
deserving it, from pure love;
and now that you are in your kingdom,
do not forget us. May we not be lost
like wood smoke that is blown away
without a trace by the wind; but take us
in your hands and carry our souls
to your Fathers granary, where we await
the day when the bread of Universe
is kneaded from your body, and may
we eat of it throughout the centuries!
Lord, we are needy souls who grow
in ragged tatters, like stalks of grain
on a threshing fielda swirl of husks
that are blown over it by the wind
gathered in heaps under showers
of intense blackness; may the glow
of your whiteness stretch across
the infinite vault of your Fathers house
the abode of eternityand may it cast
the bright light of hope over the path
of our journey, for as long as there is God!
Standing there with your arms wide open
and with your right hand extended,
help us traverse our rocky life
the steep slope of Calvaryheld fast
to our duty by the nails; and may we die
like You, standing with our arms wide open,
and like You, may we rise up to Glory
standing, so that God may speak to us
standing and with open arms. Lord,
when the time comes that my tired
heart stops beating and I must abandon
the dream of this dark night, grant that
may I enter the bright day which never ends
with my eyes fixed on your white body,
Son of Man, Humanity completed,
under the increate light which never dies:
with my eyes fixed on your eyes, Christ,
with my vision drowned in You, Lord!
Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
Your long hair hides your ears,
like the mystery that hides your Father.
Our faith depends, not on what He tells us,
but on whether He hears us. How can the Father
be deaf, if He is not silent? Since the heavens
have told us of Gods Glory in the highest,
can they not hear the prayers that ascend
from our mouths? Why does the sea moan
plaintively, and why do birds sing so sweetly,
if the blue vault of the sky, which is the ear
of your Father, is deaf to our cries
of anguish? You hide your Nazarene
ears underneath an innocent veil,
but they still hear us. They are two roses
that open under the shower of the fleeting
lament for our nothingness; they are two sea
shells that collect the sobs coming from
the waves of tears on the high seas
of our night, that hear our intense longing
to live forever. The Word, precisely
because of what it is, cannot be deaf;
it lives from them, and You, from prayers!
God, my rock.
Beneath the veil of your flesh the skeleton
is visible; it is the rock of your body which is
a rock from the rock of you mother.
And if your rock did not flourish once it
was dead, our faith would have no purpose,
the world would be an unending futility;
our days would be filled with shadows
and mankind, no more than a shadowy dream.
Lord, will you return as flesh and blood
at the end of our time, and under the spell
of your voice, like an army that rattles
the earth to its core, will the bones
of those who sleep in the dust awaken
and sing with joy? And as your blood
spills over those resurrected bones,
will it cause them to flourish in bodies
where memory returns? Because memory,
Lord, is our Spirit; and going to sleep
on the pillow of memory, is a life
that is worth the cost. Memory is
the flower of eternity; it is the weighty
tome, the Idea-Flesh, and You are
the memory of God, the open book
of those who live; You have placed
the flesh of God on the bones of the earth;
You have been our rock and our breath!
Death does not hold you; you hold it
cradled in your arms. You gave it
your flesh as a lure and, conquered by your
astuteness, it became your prey. You entered
the doorway to the Kingdom of Death,
and on touching your corpse, Elisha,
those who were dead came back to life:
what was once the tomb of Death becomes
a resurrection in the cradle of your cross.
With your death, You sustain our life;
your silence is a gift that fills the heavens;
You are unchanging, always the same,
because we are completely contained in You:
You, the Man, a living Idea. The Word
that became flesh. You; the substance
of man is the Word, and our triumph
occurs when flesh becomes Word, making us
angels of the Lord. When the word
became flesh, our Jesus, you were with us
to make our poor sinful flesh become
words that dwell in heaven forever,
and your death on the cross was the gift
of resurrection for our bodies.
Like the dove with silver feathers,
which flew out of the ark for the third time
and did not return with an olive branch,
but disappeared in the clouds beneath
the rainbow, the sign of a promise;
thus You, white dove of the heavens,
have come to tell us there is dry land,
a place where our spirit can take root
and where it can flourish for eternity!
On the grass that covers the secluded
dwelling where your soul is waiting
in its cocoon of dust, the rain falls
from the sky and awakens a gentle
murmur. It is the enchanting song
of the ultimate mystery; it is the lullaby
of our last love, the sweet murmuring
of our Mother Earth, tired of giving birth
to men who then come back to rest
in her dark bosom. The poor thing feels
that in her womb past sorrows merge
with the future, and she sorrowfully
cradles her dead, as she bows her head
to those whose pain is yet to come.
Now death has brought you peace,
my friend! You who came to bring war
to our world, a creative war,
a feeling of huge desires, a hurricane
caused by the souls who created
waves of emotion with the obsession
of capturing the stars in their bosom;
a war with God, like Jacob, when he went
in search of his brother, because Glory
is conquered by struggle; Glory is the goal
of those who want peace; a war that is Glory.
Only through your spiritual war are we able
to achieve peace, your kiss of greeting;
only fighting for heaven, Christ,
can we mortals achieve peace.
But let it be your peace, Brother, and not
the fraud that the world offers, until that day
when the lion lies down with the ox,
and the hawk nests with the dove;
because the war for peace was your passion.
Between your arms your bosom opens
without deception, like a meadow of love;
following the never-ending path of the sun
that does not set and never rises, You embrace
the infinite within the enormous breadth
of your suffering. And with your arms,
divine Atlas, you encompass everything,
from dawn to dusk, and not on your shoulders
but on your chest, You lift it up
to the heavens. This is the unmovable
source of strength, where the world rests
on the threshold of God. On your bosom,
all Creation is supported by Love,
the footstool of Glory. If You had not
been born, our Mother Earth would
be surrounded by empty space,
resting on nothingness; but now it rests
on the bosom of the child from its womb,
on You, the pillar of the world. Inside
your bosom is a framework of manly ribs,
like those with which your Father
created woman, because you, Christ, are
the marrow within our bones. And your
bosom was filled with fresh air
that was surrounded by olive trees
and now envelops earth with its mantle,
painting the blue sky before our eyes
like a blessing. Like the white ocean
it undulated with the breath of life;
like the white sea under the sun, in waves
of love, while it lived; and now it sleeps
a peaceful sleep in mortal repose.
Seek the divine root of your soul which is
like that of your brother, uniting you with him,
and learn to be faithful to the sacred
discipline which teaches pure love.
Listen to your human self which tells you:
"I am everyone; all happiness and all human
suffering is reflected in my soul",
and always scorn all false zealotry.
The weak have created the absurd idea
that anger, not acts of love,
is the basis for our accomplishments,
but our mind tries in vain to cover
the light of our heart with lies, because
compassion always inspires the strong.
And your bare shepherds feet
passed through the door of the sheepfold
where they caressed the humble earth
with their five toes—flesh on the ground
which was sanctified by their nakedness—;
they were surrounded by the swift waters
of the River Jordan as though caught
by the anchor of eternity while they
rested their soles on the stones
of the riverbed, a furrow in our mother earth;
they were coated with the dust of the roads
—now you are gone, sunken Capernaum,
Bethsaida and Chorazin!—; they ran
through the grass covered with dew
—your soft green cushion—or over stones
coated with your blood, filled with love
for the poor lamb that had gone astray;
Mary bathed them with her tears
and dried them with her hair;
they were kissed by the gentle waves
that lapped the shores of Tiberias;
they scaled Mount Tabor and made
the rocks beneath them tremble with love
as they were coated with the blood
from the nails, allowing the rocky soil
to drink—soil that was trampled
by the painful steps of the wounded feet,
of those who were fleeing, without
direction or purpose, from the death
they were trying to avoid—the pure blood
of those humble feet that were traveling
resignedly to their death, following
the path of shame and sorrow.
The path that descends to the center
of the black kingdom of departed souls
whose thirst had been quenched by death;
and the dust—remnants of hearts
that once were beating with desire—
now drinks the water of eternity!
L'homme est périssable. Il se peut; mais
périssons en resistant, et si le néant nous est
réservé, ne faisons pas que ce soit une justice.
Just in case there is no life after death,
live in a way that makes our annihilation
an injustice; let your life be
a protest against the avarice of God.
This gives us an unfulfilled longing,
and wrapped in the caress of its light
it shoots an obscure arrow of pain
into the deepest recesses of our heart.
Wearied by the deception, lay your head
on the rock that was the resting place
of Prometheus, and when you are finally
overcome by the cruel wheel of fate,
as a consolation for your death you can
cry: My God, why have you forsaken me?
You are the white doorway to the heavens,
always open to the one who knocks, where
the splendor of darknessheart of the divine
is opened. The leaves of the door open wide
on the right is justice and on the left
is mercyand on the hinges of the rosary
they open readily to the solid
wooda firm supportof the cross.
The lintel of your cross is the tomb of Adam,
and resting on the crossbar is a scowling
Lucifer lurking in the darkness!
Poor Lucifer, star of the evening,
converted into a shadow of darkness,
fallen from heaven like a bolt of lightening!
Give him your hand, Lord, and let him pour
his shadow into the darkness of your Father
and become, once again, a morning star!
The heavens are rent; you are an opening
to God, and the one who sees Him
through You will die; he dies of love
and then recovers his life,
a life that never dies. And your cross
is a bridge made from tears and blood
that leads us to You, since you are the white
doorway to the house of God, leading us
through the somber depths of this poor world
which surrounds the celestial Castle!
You are Eagle and Man, Lion and Bull
the Sphinx, the Cherubim of our fate.
And only by deciphering your parables
can we, poor mortals,
live with love. Because you are
the eternal book of five seals
wrapped around the cross, which
is printed with letters of blood on leaves
of spotless parchment taken from
the depths of your body, and which
can only be read by love. Your whiteness
is sprinkled with bloody enigmas;
for the worlds vain understanding
it is only a source of blind skepticism,
and your cross is a source of scandal.
No one in heaven or on earth
(nor beneath it) could open the book:
only love can open it with red blood.
Only love is able to use the five
keys which decipher its whiteness.
When you died on the cross, heaven
was opened like a book, a book of flesh,
and the Word that created said to us:
Take this book and eat it; if it is bitter
for the stomach, it will be sweetness and honey
in the mouth. And this book is You.
The book is alive, it is Master, and its death
gives the lesson it has printed with its blood,
not a lesson of words puffed up by the wind,
but the supreme lesson of eternal life!
Lift the white banner of faith
above the dust that covers the battle
while science prattles, wisdom listens
and is silent, and art creates.
One must live and it is necessary
to fight against the base rabble
who responds to the crack of the whip
and shouts, we have to die! Do your part
and wait for that of God who scorns
those who give up. Direct your bloody
footsteps through the mortal fields
toward the glow of your eternal star;
we must achieve a life that does not end,
with reason, without reason, or opposed to it.
When everything under your bloody
feet is subjected to your Father
and the entire Creation is a pedestal
of Glory at the foot of the Man,
you will surrender your body,
the abode of the Word; and subjected
to the power of God, All will be All
in Him for eternity. And You, Lord
of the deep and all-encompassing sea,
since You became the Ruler of our Vision
the entire Universe is humanized by you,
and Man is the purpose of Creation!
May God give you a cool head,
a warm heart, an open hand,
a precise tongue, an ear with a shield,
and feet without haste or sluggishness.
When man stumbles on the path of life
under the burden of his pain,
it is his own weight that hinders him
from rising from the ground. Our sadness
affects us, and it is the most harmful
element in our poor lives, since living
under its influence is no life at all.
Dont use works to measure your success,
but the souls pure faith which gives it
the ability to rise up again after it falls.
Ruler of the vast homeland
of an infinite Humanity, You lead us,
a battalion of crusaders, in the capture
of a heavenly Jerusalem, a cloister
of outworn law and dominion
over our eternal future; the only place
of freedom—of which you are the epitome—
the city of God, the final home of Man;
a Christian Universe, that with your blessing
has forged in mankind the Man Himself.
You said: My kingdom is not of this world!;
your kingdom is the leaven of history,
not transitory, but eternal; your kingdom,
a Humanity without borders or limits,
a triumph of the eternal Holy Spirit!
When the people wanted to proclaim
you king after you multiplied the fish
and the bread, you withdrew by yourself
to the mountain, since your kingdom
is not of this world; however, Death
made you the King of Life. Your anathema,
in three tonguesJesus of Nazareth,
King of the Jewsabove your throne,
reveals your passion. Solitary
white King of solitude, naked king,
by the grace of God and of death:
the cross is your throne, and your crown
is the ring of thorns that encircles
your black hair and draws blood from
your forehead that covers your eyes.
From the burning bush which was not
consumed, in the desert near Mount Horeb,
the mountain of God, a royal crown
was made which shines over your hair,
which is black as night, like a nimbus
of sparks, creatures of the shadow
of your pain, which is intense contemplation.
You bow your head under the obscure
weight of human destiny; your crown
of thorns offers prophetic visions of
how your teachings must be followed,
for which they will make you king of this world.
Those drops of blood from your forehead
are beads of sweat from the thoughts
which have already been misunderstood,
drops of your most intimate passion.
Your knees are not bowed, but upright
like one who is walking, because your death
is a journey, not a repose. And with the nails
You spurred the cross, your battle charger,
goading it onward in your flight,
not directed by it for, like a good artisan,
you know how to control your tools,
and using it you draw all of us along.
And with your legs nailed to the cross,
You became a stumbling block for the Devil
making him bite the bloody dust,
and You carefully left our trespasses
to the annoyance of your angry Father!
Your face, a reflection of Glory,
dropped to the ground, and you kissed
the mother goodbye, while the kiss
of your Father filled your tormented
heart with anguish. And your sweat
moistened the dust of the earth, blessing it,
as you gave water to the olive trees
that heard your lament. Their foliage
was trembling above You, next to the wings
of the Angel of Grief. And you asked that
the cup of sorrow be removed from you.
But no, my Adam, by watering our soil
with the drops of your blood, You give us
the bread of our life. As a consolation,
You strove to gain courage by struggling
against sorrow with the help of the earth,
a storehouse of sorrows. To fulfill
your divinity you needed to experience
the anguish of death. So you blessed
the remains of the hearts that had once
been beating with love. And you spat on
the ground that, anointed with your blood,
gave sight to the blind. We see because of this,
the soil anointed with saliva from your tongue,
with which the Word had spoken;
through the clay with which God made us,
you saw the depths of our misfortune.
With the soil made divine by your Word
placed over our eyes, we can see the mysteries
of afterlife. Lord, do not hide your face
from us, because that would deliver us,
like vain sparks, to the center of nothingness.
...¦and life everlasting, amen!
Bow your head, mournful Sadducee
and contemplate the dust which is your origin;
know that with the Tower of Babel
you cannot defeat heaven, and that life
amounts to nothing if there is no afterlife.
What is the life that began that day
during a red sunset, when the burning sword
of the Angel of the Lord shone at the door
of Paradise? Tell me: what is life if,
like dry leaves blown by the wind,
our souls only fertilize the earth
and wait for the scythe while the tree
of life casts a shadow over our death?
Why strive to know if, in the end,
our effort is nothing more than the act
of knowing? Tell me: what became of
the foaming waves that lapped the shore?
And those others that stretched to the sky
and with their foam tried to erase
the stars? Tell me: what is it that endures?
I know, sad Sadducee, that you asked
with bitter laughter: what wife can we have
when we are dead? Tell me, if you can,
what life is this, if we are waiting only
for whatever is when we no longer are?
Let go of your envy, mournful Sadducee;
allow our hopes to lull us to sleep,
and on our lips with our final breath,
may the Credo be our final prayer.
And You, sleeping Christ, my dream,
as I sleep in your arms, may my soul
conquer life while You dream!
Your journey from this short life
into eternity was not sickness, but health;
your wounds were not the cracks or chinks
of a ruin; nor were your limbs broken
pieces which survived the ravages of your
terrible suffering; there was no pus
in your wounds, there were no cracks
in your formation, nor was your flesh
food for maggots; the vital source
of your human thoughts did not
become a skull, since your death was
health, wellness and youthful vigor;
it was robustness all the way to the
marrow of your bones. Your mother,
our humble earth, is not a creature
that looses its original state of health,
young shepherd Abel, but your brothers
have severed the thread of your life;
your death was not natural, but human.
You died without touching the ground,
Knight of eternal forgiveness, staunch rider
on the back of your cross; and in your final
battle you did not end your suffering
in the lap of your mother. You returned
to earth as healthy as you were born from it:
safe and sound, with no stain or blemish;
your death made it a virgin and a mother.
And you keep on dying; your death
is an endless sacrifice that becomes
our eternal life; for You we keep on dying,
always coming back to life. The health
of your death is a cure for the sickness
of our life. Together, You and your Mother
have put together the scattered limbs
of the unborn Adam; together you formed
the new Humanity which, burning
with love, like a Phoenix in the nest
of flames from your bosom, is reborn
and it rises up until it touches God!
You toss and turn from one side to the other
in search of rest; you cannot find it either
on your right or on your left, and your bed
becomes a rocking horse. But remember
when in your public life you criticized
all those whose souls were consumed
by sadness, so do not make it worse with
facile diatribes. The one who presumes
to know it all is like the man who boasts
about his health and insults a poor sick patient
by turning his strength into arrogance;
the day will come when the healthy
braggart will collapse, and it will be obvious
that it wasnt health, but ignorance.
White Christ who gave your blood
for us, bloodless Christ
who gave the fluid of your veins
for our old poisoned blood;
a dried up lake, your whiteness brightens
that river of blood and covers the valley
of tears under your feet. The blood
you shed in forgiveness casts
an eternal light on all that it touched;
the blood you gave us is what remains,
soft white bread, your white body. Blood;
your red blood like the light that is filtered
through grains—petals—of pure gold,
an undreamed of flower of the spirits
of earth in a time that was incandescent.
Blood! Blood! Because of you, Christ,
blood is the wine that quenches the souls
terrible thirst that oppresses the universe.
The clusters of trembling stars that fill
the heavenly vault—the grapevine
that protects our earth from the eternal
sun that does not burn—those clusters
of stars, what do they emanate, but blood?
What is their light, but blood that burns
with love? Blood that fills us during
the life of our body, and redeems us;
love does not give fruit without blood. When
you shed it completely, you became white;
your body, white like soft white bread,
white like the bloodless moon
that circles the earth, cold and white,
carrying the torch of unending love
during the night of our world. The moon
became blood. You, Son of Man,
were of our blood, and for us
you shed it all and covered men
with the sea of your blood. You, lamb
of the blood of boundless love,
with this red blood you removed
the stain of sin—the awareness
of doing wrong that causes remorse—
and you let us walk free from the heavy
burden which opresses our heart.
Oh Christ of forgiveness! You forgive us
even before we sin, and thus we can
avoid the storm which leads us
to the depths of perdition. You forgive
the man who knows not what he does:
your white lunar light is forgiveness!
Poor Satan, expelled from your seat
next to the throne of the Lord of Mercy,
you who cannot lessen the harmful
condition of your sin with tears.
So you must not cry, proud Satan,
caught in the net of an unparalleled fear,
the fear of a truth you cannot acknowledge;
poor Satan, the father of disappointment!
You struggle endlessly, condemned
to live with yourself forever,
and as you try to forget and relieve
your boredom, you fill our life
with temptations, holding us hostage
while you envy our mortality.
Do you like this? Yes? Well it will continue.
No? Just the same, for those who do not want
to accept it as it is, God made me the purveyor
of His provocative ideas, so I will repeat the pure
and simple truth, even though it is obscure,
and in the end I will accept my payment
although I know it cannot be in gold coins
without ever giving up my insistent search.
While you continue with your old farce,
I will take refuge here in my solitude
where I tighten my belt and keep on fighting;
I dont need to jump on the bandwagon,
because I know that my brave soldier carries
his sword next to his shield like a warrior.
Then Moses made a bronze serpent and set
it on a pole in the desert; if a fiery serpent
or a scorpion bit any man he would
look at the bronze serpent and be healed;
white serpent, with compassionate eyes
which see all human sorrow, you heal
whoever looks at you. The original
serpent, the dragon that rebelled
against God, coiled wickedly around
the tree of knowledge and tempted
our parents, bringing perdition to the world.
And You, white dragon of our salvation
hanging from the Tree of Death,
accept all the poison from our sorrow.
Your love is awesome, Dragon of fire,
from whom the waters of life are flowing.
With his hatchet the woodcutter of death
mutilated our tree of knowledge
by carving your cross like he carves a horse,
and on it he was strangled to death
between your strong arms of love!
The majesty of your torment shines
with the light of your complete resignation,
an acceptance that is absolute freedom,
and your words, Your will be done!
cast a brilliant light on your martyrdom.
Silence, nakedness, repose and night
enclose You, Jesus, becoming the angels
of your death; God in His darkness
is silent and naked. From the Father
within, only silence is heard;
the murmur of your love beckons us
to our nest with a gentle whisper,
held in your arms above the darkness
through which the sun of life is breaking!
All men think all men mortal but themselves
I will reject the truth if the truth destroys
our hope not to die, since this is my port
of salvation on the uncertain path that
I am following. If it takes away
the deceptive illusion that connects us
to our lifean ever-present deception!
it is better to live a lie that saves us
than to be enlightened and dead.
But how can we go on living, knowing
it is a deception? In the same way that
a herd of pigs flees from the angry sow
who roots in the dirt for her ideal;
because desperation is the foundation
on which hope creates its objective.
Oh winter sunshine whose beautiful light
filters through the bare, leafless branches,
beguiling us mercifully with your golden
vitality and brightening the cloudy sky
after our siesta; your warm light provides
the clothing which covers the throng
of the poor, and in this way you fulfill
the purpose of life that renders homage
to our sad old age. Oh merciful sun
who gives ice its diamantine brilliance,
be my consolation when my forehead
falls to the earth, my ultimate destiny,
and let the red light of your sunset cover
the smooth path to my final night.
Forsaken by God, your Father,
who with His hands received your spirit,
you rise up on this painful throne
of solitude above the barren ground
on the hill of the skull, above the forest
of lifeless souls who waited for
your death, which is their life. An austere
throne of solitude! You, alone,
forsaken by God and by men and angels,
link between heaven and earth, you die,
oh Lion of Judah, King of the Desert
and of solitude! You know the souls
solitudes, and You convert all men
into just one man; You unite us,
and with your help the souls roll on
in a single wave. Because You died,
oh Jesus Christ, to bring together
all the scattered children of God:
only one flock with just one shepherd.
Poor soul, you who travel alone
through the sands of the desert,
carrying on your back those lonely
sorrows which lack the brilliant glow
of martyrdom! Wave after wave of
the hot sirocco washes over you,
and the crass multitude of hyenas
finally violates your peace of mind.
Life is solitude; you are born alone
and you die alone; alone under the ground
you will hear from above the sad complaint
of another soul wandering alone in the desert;
so you came alone to the valley of pain
only to have your solitude turn out to be war.
The trunk of the cross has been trimmed
of its branches; below it one cannot make out
the ground since its greenness has melted
into whiteness of your body. The world
of Nature has culminated in your bosom:
when You became human, You humanized
the world made conscious by your pain.
The only way to approach You, the Man,
is through Nature; You, the obscure
wet nurse of earth, with your hands
anointed by blood, hold it up to heaven
like a Host, and You place it in the light
of the eternal Sun whose whiteness drowns
its greenness, transforming it into an idea.
You, the Man, became supernatural,
by humanizing all that was natural.
Forests, mountains, seas and deserts
converge in your bosom, and in You are
rocks and plants, beasts, fish and birds.
Your body is like a Noahs Ark where
all the children born of our Mother Earth
have been saved from the deluge
and given as an inheritance to Mankind.
The sacred Earth that has clothed You
with living flesh, the naked Word of God,
was sanctified by the blood of that same
flesh; within it there is not one speck
of dust that is not part of God.
God traced the mystery of human life
using the ebony mantle of stars
in the night, and you unlocked
His secret with drops of His blood shed
over the Earth, as a sacred testament!
Lift me up to the Father, Mother of Grace,
and put me in His arms so that there my soul
may sleep; it is sick from lack of rest, and now
the insomnias of doubt have weakened my faith.
Ask your Beloved to give me restful sleep
and let His warmth penetrate my soul like sperm;
it is only in sleep that His warmth can alleviate
the diabolical boldness of this empty life.
This anxious bread of toil  demands sleep,
sleep in the arms of the Lord where the cradle
made from the sacred wood of pain rocks back
and forth. This sleep is a mystical pool
where in the eternal baptism of April showers,
with help of our sister death, life is renewed.
While you have raised your arms,
those of Amalek have been lowered,
and this victory quickens our steps
and soothes our brow. And you raise
your cross on high, like the staff of Moses,
not with your hand, but with your whole body
which the angels are supporting.
You are the banner of the Lord, a banner
of human flesh woven by the Holy Spirit
in the bosom of our Mother Earth.
Earth, divine Earth, our Mother;
you, a slave of the sun, a dark star;
virgin earth, wrapped in clouds:
your mountains are maternal breasts
from which water from the heavens falls
on the thirsty valleys, and the foliage
of your green forests shades our dreams.
Your lap is the soft grass that cradles
the soul so that it can sleep forever;
your bosom that gives us bread, gives the Righteous
their flesh, food for a greedy Death;
breadbasket earth, you gave birth to Him!
The red earth, the deep blue sky, the harsh
sun reaches it zenith and sends out
its beams; it is the hottest time of the day;
the green leaves on the hill become dark.
In the rounded shadow of the immobile
black evergreen oak, the immobile black
bull is resting, and a pond becomes
a motionless mirror of silent water.
Vision is suspended like a veneer
over the recently forged oven of calm,
and it fills the space with quietude;
but, alas!, whenever eternity distracts us,
as a reminder of what is to come,
the cicada chirps the instants of time.
White bull with face like a crescent moon,
pure bull without blemish who has now
descended from the cross to the yoke,
pouring your blood over our earth
which is the altar of your Fathers temple;
sacrificial calf, leader
of the herd, both priest
and resigned victim;
you who ruminate on our sorrows
and with cloven feet plough the valleys
whose greenness is watered by our tears,
of you can we eat, since your flesh is pure.
You, calf whose flesh is nourished
by the harvest over which the children
of Adam have toiled, by burning
the golden calf in your fire, you reduce it
to dust, which you pour into the water
you give us to drink, and thus
you obtain for us your fathers pardon!
Being born is the only thing man ever does
with seriousness; after that everything threatens
to become a farce, and since God provides
no remedy, nor does the cruel pain of sorrow,
he becomes an actor. While doing this
his life is besieged by a profound sadness
and his death becomes a scene of comedy,
although still the prologue of a mystery.
Being mythical, these theatrical steps
are usually filled with magical effects,
and for sad economic reasons
these two moments of life are crucial:
births are almost always tragic
and deaths are almost always comical.
You are the Truth which with its death,
followed by resurrection, gives us life.
What is the truth? Pilate asked while
washing his hands, as he delivered you;
but You are the truth, and your blood
washes away all that is sinful in us.
You are the truth which consoles us
for our death; a torrent of pure water
that satisfies our thirst, not the world
that fills our vision. That is deception
and deceit, not Nature; what we see
is an illusion of the senses,
a lure forged by a hungry death,
a death which constantly pursues us
in order to swallow us. You are the cure
for the the illusions of a deceitful world
which permeate the core of our spirit
and wrap us in never-ending error!
Underneath the veil of mystery
that girds your loins
the cloth that dried your disciples feet
when they were washed, after which
the entire man was cleansedunder that veil
the loins girded as though in motion
the strength of the man, Lord, is hidden.
From the blessed Eve, the virgin mother,
You, blessed Adam, took the flesh
of a sinful father from a virgin womb
and you placed it on the bed of the cross.
You gave birth when you died; it was
your death that made you the father
of our life; your death was the vital result
of your manhood; then, because of it,
You knew the bride of Humanity
and You became her bridegroom of blood.
Without You, Jesus, we are born only
to die; but with You we die to be born
once more, and so you give birth to us!
In your stomach is the food they prepared
for your last supper, since you eat
and drink as a man among friends;
your stomach of ivory and sapphires,
a shield that covers and protects
the physical center of your manhood
as it nourishes your body. Your mouth
sanctifies all that you chew and swallow,
turning blood into wine and flesh into bread.
Within it the law of God was established
to preserve us for His service.
On your stomach, like the point of shield
or the center of a bulls-eye, is the place
a sunspotwhere your body
was connected to your mother; through it
you received the fluid of our mother earth,
the blood for the salvation of our sin.
It is the hallmark of your Davidic lineage,
a proclamation of humanity, marking the spot
where the Kingdom of God touches that of man,
and they are joined. Your navel is the hub
that forms the axis of the universe.
During the nine months that you spent
in the darkness of your mothers womb,
from the bosom of woman, the flesh of Eve,
you received the blood of forgiveness,
the human blood that paid for our sins.
This spot shows us that You were born
to feel pain like the rest of us mortals;
You too, were a poor organism locked
within the dark prison of a human womb,
and during your prenatal dream you tasted
unconsciousness, the portal of life,
sampling the dark substance of dread
that is felt by the one who desires to live.
On top of Calvary your cross dug
a hole when it was planted in the earth,
the navel through which the blood of God,
filled with pain, flows into our mother!
The solid crossbeam of pain
with the stone of remorse
working by means of guilt,
has unloaded its sorrows on your
heart; and rising up like virgins
over the divine winepress of your breast,
the poor sinful hands of Eve extracted
the liquid that washes our sorrows.
Wine is a poor thing in the desert where
there is no water, the source of greenness;
wine is sad like blood, and sorrowful unto
death is your soul, Jesus. But since we
have not yet entered the infinite depths
of the divine ocean, your juice has
permeated the winding rivers that have
carried us on this painful journey
through the desert of human life;
it is your wine, Lord, your own blood,
your sorrowful wine of pain, the wine
from the vine of which we are the branches.
The wine is sad, yes, but it intoxicates
and it makes us dream and forget.
Oh the intoxication of the redeeming blood,
the wine of the desert without water;
madness of the cross, savory pain,
detachment from life, you remove
the taste of vinegar from the sponge
of the worlds empty consolation!
And in the wine of your blood, oh Christ!,
there is also pure water without stain,
the liquor of life that quenches the thirst
of the one who drinks it for all eternity;
and it will become in him a spring of water
constantly welling up to eternal life.
"Know yourself"; the philosophy
of the divine Greece
culminated in this flower of its teaching,
the rose of knowledge!
"Know yourself", and this self
is found outside myself;
God is within me; God has created me
and it is God who sustains me;
God merges with me, and in my heart
He fills my entire life.
I cannot reach myself without passing through
His divine essence;
When I die my secret will be revealed;
I will know God when I die.
Like the night, you invite us to rest
our head, burdened by the weight
of distressing sorrows, on the pillow
of your pallid breast, which is bare
and unmoving with the stillness of death
that is eternal life; you offer a repose
which relieves the torment of the soul
that is condemned to wait. And resting
on your heart (a limitless expanse
of immortal humanity, like an endless sea
that reflects the calmness of the heavens)
our sorrows are eased. A tranquil
light pours out from your heart;
from there your arms spread over the world,
and your silence says to us: Brothers,
come to me and ease your sorrows;
I am the moon which fills the valley
with a lake of shining white milk
that cradles dreams. The soft night
of your abundant black Nazarene
hair falls with tenderness over
your brow (a place for divine ideas)
and the veil that covers your suffering
heart shines as white as the moon;
because you gave your life for us.
The light of God is reflected in the glow
of your heart which no longer beats,
and your body is a transparent curtain
over your heart. Your quiet white chest
like the shade of a lamp, does not breathe:
like a lake without waves reflecting
the peaceful serenity of the sky,
it sheds a motionless light with no beginning.
Oh quiet light without waves, timeless light,
boundless and unfathomable sea of light,
a sea of death that does not destroy
and of life that does not surpass the sea!
At sunset on the day when you died
the sun disappeared amid bleeding clouds,
amid prophetic clouds that foreshadowed
the tormented longing of men.
After being carried from the sea
to a cage, the poor imprisoned quail,
jumps, longing to be free and fly out
over the fields; but in its futile efforts
to jump, it splatters the roof of the cage
with blood from its head, and sometimes
it succumbs, a victim of its own desires.
Is not the blood of that setting sun
a symbol of the sorrowful thoughts
of the poor human soul who jumped up
in a mad attempt to examine the vault
of blue sky, to open it and see the eyes
of the One who sent You to give your blood
in exchange for that tragic blood?
A condor from the Andes was cruelly
blinded, and the grim monarch
of the peaks, thinking he was at the bottom
of a dark ravine, began to fly rising
carefully in order to prevent his wings
from striking against the sharp rocks;
searching for light without sight, he rises
and, finding nothing, he continues to climb;
he rises so high that the air becomes thin
and it is difficult to fly or to breathe;
scarcely able to suck in air, he continues
seeking the light with his empty eyes,
but his curved beak drops over his heart
which had burst, and he plummets down dead.
This is like the man with an insatiable spirit
who rises to the heights in search of light,
scarcely able to breathe or to fly, still seeking
knowledge, in spite of his suffocation;
but You, Light of Glory, came down
to give men the life that was light,
the light that shines in the darkness,
illuminating your brothers who were left
to breathe the polluted air of this land,
air mixed with the fog of their tears
and the sweat of their penitence.
Your death brought God down to earth.
You have given earth the true light,
and with it you have cleansed our souls;
with your blood, which is light, you have turned
our souls into blood, giving sight to the blind.
In the beginning God blinded us so that,
like Saul on the road to Damascus, we were able,
to die at your feet; and with your death
He gave us the light we had struggled to find
in the heights of human knowledge.
Go, stir the brazier coals, my child;
The fire is growing cold.
How brief today the sun has smiled!
To think the orb that you behold
One day shall cinder turn,
And God's great brow, the heavens, enfold
Its ashes like an urn.
With those eyes that probed
the darkness of the bowels of the earth,
your friend, Lazarus of Bethany,
had come back from the tomb after
living in two different worlds. Seeing
you dead on the cross he wept,
remembering how you wept for him.
With her virginal eyes fixed on You,
your mother drank in your whiteness,
and all of your passion was poured
from your silent heart into hers
that was crucified with an infinite grief.
John contemplated your body with his
aquiline eyes, and beyond you he saw
the ageless sun and all the people,
the timeless guideposts of history. When
Thomas saw you lifeless, he hesitated
to believe his eyes, and with his hand
he tried to feel the whiteness of death
on your body. A disillusioned Peter
looked at the sad spectacle, and falling
from his eyes, a fountain of tears
began to wash away the trail of blood
you left on Calvary. Nicodemus,
a reluctant disciple by night,
contemplated your cross from afar,
feeling his heart beginning to beat
again in his breast. Mary Magdalene
could see only a single cloud through
the tears in her eyes: all was covered
with the darkness of night. James regarded
the city with anger and clenched his fist
with a frown. Stephen, a tender youth
with an angelic face, carefully picked up
the pebbles with drops with drops
of your blood, like relics. And meanwhile,
there in his Tarsus, on the edge of the Ionic
Sea, was Saul the Pharisee, his weak
eyes poring over the scrolls of Hellenic
wisdom with eager desire, striving
to be their Mercury among his people.
Still far away and lost in obscurity
the spirit of Athanasius was contemplating
the luminous darkness, and was seeing
the Creators creation, a patient action,
a finite infinity that would humanize God
so that we mortals could also be gods.
Falling from the sky over your forehead,
a drop of blood poured out of
the curved beak of a surfeited vulture
that came from the Caucasus, and your blood
mixed with that of Prometheus.
With those arms nailed to the cross
you, Master Carpenter, have built a house
of God on our poor earth, giving it
a dwelling on our soil. Four nails,
crafted by mankind, nailed you
to the tree of your death, and our life,
creating a place of love on our soil
for your Father. And here is a home
for your sacred head, in which the increate
Word resides while resting on your breast
like a cushion; and as it touches you
it feels its humanity, since that is its goal.
My beloved is all white...
Questo occhio vede in quella bianchezza tucto Dio
el tucto Homo, la natura divina unita
con la natura umana.
Santa Caterina da Siena.
Libro della Divina Dottrina,capítulo CXI
Of what do You think, Christ, after your death?
Why does that veil of blackest night
formed by your thick Nazarene hair
fall down over your forehead?
You look within yourself, where the Kingdom
of God is, within yourself where the eternal
Sun of the living souls is dawning.
Your body is white like a reflection
of the Father of Light, the life-giving Sun;
your body is white like the dead moon
that rotates around its mother,
our tired and wandering earth;
your body is white like the Host
of the sky during the deepest night,
of that sky which is black like the veil
head of hair.
You, Christ, are the unique
Man who succumbed willingly,
who triumphed over death which
because of You has become exalted. Since then,
because of You, death brings us life;
because of You, death has become our mother;
because of You, death is the sweet balm
which sweetens lifes bitterness:
because of You, the Corpse who does not die,
white like the moon of the night. Christ,
life is a dream, and death is an awakening.
While the solitary earth is sleeping
the white moon is awake; on His cross
the Man is awake while men are asleep;
the Man with no blood is awake, the Man
who is white like the moon in the dark night;
the Man who gave His blood remains awake
so that others will know they are men.
You are the savior of death. You open your arms
to the night, which is black and beautiful,
because the Sun of life has looked on it
with its eyes of fire: because the Sun
has made the dark night so very beautiful.
And the solitary moon is also beautiful,
the white moon in the starry night,
which is black like your abundant
Nazarene hair. The moon is white
like the body of the Man on the cross, a mirror
of the Sun of life, of the one who never dies.
Master, the beams of your soft light
guide us through the dark night of this world,
anointing us with the fervent hope
of an eternal day. Blessed night,
oh night, mother of pleasant dreams,
mother of hope, sweet Night,
dark night of the soul, you are the source
of our hope in Christ the Savior.
Into your hands I commend my spirit!,
you said to your Father, before whom
the waters trembled, and the earth shivered
in an agony of birth. And it was the long
awaited soul: that of Adam. Feeling jealous
now that your blood flowed through
its bones, the earth shook off the layer
of maternal clay which had covered it.
Through His mouth God gave it a soul,
and through your mouth he gave it your
final breath, Jesus, an eternal fountain
which sings in the depths of the forest.
Into your hands I commend my spirit!
Into the invisible hands of your Father,
the foundation and roof of the abyss,
the hands that made us in your image;
surrendering yourself to sorrow, you rested
your spirit in His all-powerful hands!
In a little while the world will not see me,
but you will see me; because I live
you will live also, you said; and now the eyes
of faith have seen you in the depths
of the soul, and by virtue of art we have
created you in visible form. Our magic wand
was the paint brush of Don Diego Rodriguez
de Silva Velazquez. Because of this we can see
you in the flesh today. You are the Eternal Man
who has created us anew. Your death is
a birth. You have flown to heaven so that
the Counselor could send us the Holy Spirit,
the spirit of your flock, which works in art
to bring us your image. Incarnated here
in this silent, white Word that speaks
with lines and colors, my tragic people
have expressed their faith. It is the ultimate
passion play which raises us from death,
so that we are face to face with God.
and the Lord for the body...
1 Corinthians 6:13.
The body is a manifestation of the soul,
the source of pain and of life,
the immortalizing body of the Man,
flesh that is an example before our eyes,
the body of God, the eternal Gospel:
the paint-brush shows us the miracle of
the Man who died to save us
from the tragic death of mankind;
it presents before our eyes a humanity
that is eternal. Eyes that are also of flesh,
of blood and of pain, and of life!
This is the God we can see; this is the Man;
this is the God on whose body our eyes
can rest, the hands of the spirit.
There is no choice but to accept your fate
as an essential part of the Story which love
elaborates; it is as though our minds
were formed in the forge of your inner being,
and we see the universe through your eyes.
The ground where I stand is shaking and my
lungs are filled with your divine breath,
so that now I can describe your blessedness
sincerely and openly, without pretense.
My tongue is on fire, and like a burning flame,
may it sing with the sound of angel wings
the lesson which your body teaches us
like a living book. Let me hungrily
devour this manuscript, until the sweet fluid
from your side oozes like honey
out of my mouth. From within me
flow rivers of living water, these poems
of mine, and may they keep on flowing
as long as they live, and may that be forever!
I have neither silver nor gold,
but I give you what I have, brothers;
I offer the totality of my entire effort
for your benefit, keeping back nothing
for myself, for God is not deceived.
It is finished
It is finished! You shouted with a roar
like a thousand cataracts, with a thunderous
voice like that of an army in battle
—your battle with death—and with your cry,
from a ghostly Alexandria, the new
heathen arrogance of pagans in Jericho,
the palm trees of Hellenic wisdom,
the walls came tumbling down, and the
gates of Rome opened for you. A vast
mystical silence followed, as if the air
had also died with you, and a new
unearthly music arose in the heart
of heaven which was distraught by the grief
of your passion. And on the sad wooden
harp of your cross, with its taut
tendons and muscles stretched out
in torment, your body emitted
a shout of pain—love without bounds—
the victorious song of life.
It is finished! Finally, death has died!
You were alone with your Father—alone
and face to face—your gazes were merged
—that of heaven with that of your blue eyes—
and when the vastness of His heart sighed,
the boundless and unfathomable sea of Spirit
trembled; and feeling Himself a man
God tasted death, in divine solitude.
Your Father chose to experience death,
and when you bowed your head and merged
your human breath with the spirit of God,
He saw Himself without the Creation.
When you took your final breath,
only the distant merciful sea responded!
A wind out of the abyss blows from above
and below so that we who are brothers
are shaken to the depths of our soul,
and reflected in this fragile mirror
the world also trembles. Those who quake
with the fear of death on seeing your distorted
image in the quicksilver, saw in You
the Judge; but this serene man, Don Diego,
the courageous overseer of this region,
who traveled at a leisurely pace through
the ordinary Castilian countryside, saw you
as though he were Apollo, with his mind
fixed on the intention of providing us
an accurate vision, which is that of art,
a school of undying, fervent devotion.
Because his was a faith that was only
satisfied visually, his soul was happy
to be a mirror which reflects the universe.
Blessed are the eyes that see what you see,
what neither prophets nor kings could see,
giving us the courage to tread on scorpions,
and to resist the power of the Tempter.
Moonbeam, come in! Thou art a welcome guest.
'Tis long since I have seen thy silver flame.
Although I left the casement open wide,
Shadows alone into my chamber came.
Ungrateful comrade, thou art still the same—
The beam transparent, gliding through the night,
The beauteous gleam of splendor from on high,
Diaphanous with amber's yellow light.
Come in! She is not here; naught canst thou spy.
Moonbeam, thou canst not now be indiscreet,
Even if thou upon the nuptial couch
Shouldst cast thy pearly radiance, clear and sweet.
O'erflow the carpet like a glittering rain,
Flood all the silent room from wall to wall,
And, clinging to the darksome drapery,
Give it the semblance of a silver shawl!
See'st thou, all things are dusty and unkempt;
The heart is chilled to view their mournful air.
Upon the blackened nail the bird cage hangs
Empty and hushed; the songbirds are not there.
See'st thou, around the railing rough the vine
Its faded blossoms wreathes; no flower we spy
Upon the rose-tree; all the lilies now
Are withered, the sweet basil plants are dry.
Thou brightness indiscreet, from heaven above!
She loved thee in the past: I love thee now.
How often have I seen thy glimmering light
Reflected from her pure and pensive brow!
The girl with golden hair is here no more—,
The dreamer, pale and white as ocean foam,
Who said, as on thy shifting light she gazed,
"It is the smile of God within our home!"
Ungrateful comrade, only thou and I
Are in this chamber, now a place of dole:
Yet welcome, heavenly brightness indiscreet!
If thou would'st see her, come into my soul!
Not a voice, not a sound
living within it.
If I plunge my hand I take out
shadow;
my pupil,
night;
my word,
thirst.
As nothing peoples the desert,
so is solitude:
as the falling of a stone in a dream,
so is solitude.
Like shadow,
night,
thirst,
true death,
impassive and upright in its kingdom,
reigning awaits.
The city was becoming 
yellow and weary 
like a sad ox. 
The mist 
was slowly penetrating
the long alleys. 
Wretched little city, remote, 
municipal, dark. 
We did not know 
what to do 
with life 
so as not always to return 
with nothing in our hands, 
like divers in the void. 
Unfinished words or impossible 
signs. 
Adolescents in the reverential 
order of families, 
and the solemn dead. 
Monday, 
Sunday, Monday. 
Rivers 
of loneliness. 
Long trains passed 
with no destination. 
And the mist came down, 
lapping the clearings, 
darkening the cold. 
Along the long alleys I had strayed 
from the enclosure of childhood, now bare, 
cut down, walled up by absence.
Fruit tree vision. It offers to my fate
honey and lavishes aromas.
I, lichen of love, climb up
crazy in the urge to bite his pomace.
My life rehearses its spiral of anguish.
I hope about the roads:
I die in the desire to empty his glass
and tie myself under the cluster of it!
Her blond apple is poisonous,
mouth of the sun that shines with blood.
My life burns if in my thirst for fire
I sink my lips into the honey of his soul.
It is the hour of enigmas,
When on a summer evening
A kite descends from the clouds
On a dole of gentle doves. 
It is the hour of enigmas!
It is the hour of a dove:
A girls gaze tracing
Their flight. A rose-hued evening.
Musical and divine tonal comma.
It is the hour of a dove!
It is the hour of a serpent:
The devil pulls out a white hair,
An apple thuds to the ground,
And shattered is the crystal of the dream.
It is the hour of a serpent!
It is the hour of a hen:
Resplendent is the cemetery with lights,
The pious cross themselves,
And the wind prophesies.
It is the hour of a hen!
It is the hour of a maiden:
Tears, letters and poems,
The air scented with orange blossoms,
Azure is the evening and star-like,
It is the hour of a maiden!
It is the hour of the barn owl: 
A sage is deciphering scriptures,
The mirror cracks,
And away goes the old woman, an oil cruet in hand.
It is the hour of the barn owl!
It is the hour of a vixen:
A guitar sounds off in the distance, 
Where the street turns round the corner,
And the old woman offers the rose ring to the lass.
It is the hour of a vixen!
It is the hour of a tormented soul:
A witch at a crossroads
Says an accursed prayer,
Asking the dead for their chains.
It is the hour of a tormented soul!
It is the hour of the dawn:
The little owl lies in wait in the pine,
The outlaw prowls on the road,
And Satan in the brothel hides. 
It is the hour of the dawn!
Under the chloroforms dizzy spell,
Both the fish-tank gleam of a modern garden
And the yellowish smell of iodine
Make me shiver with an inner shriek.
Cubist, futurist and strident,
Amidst the feverish chaos of drowsiness,
The sensation hovers, only to vanish,
Of a green fly buzzing in my brow.
Pierces my nerves now, with delightful coldness,
A violins lunatic bow;
The transparent whirr of a B-flat
Trembles in the gardens watery light,
And on sails my boat down the mighty river
That separates one boundary from another.
In memoriam
Brother, today I'm on the stone bench by the house,
where you have left us a bottomless emptiness!
I remember we used to play at this hour, and Mama
would soothe us, 'Now, boys...'
This time, I sneak away
as before, from all these prayers
at evening, and I expect you won't find me.
Through the parlor, the entryway, the halls.
Afterwards, you hide, and I don't find you.
I remember we made each other cry,
brother, in that game.
Miguel, you stole away
one August night, just before dawn:
but instead of laughing when you hid, you were sad.
And your heart's twin of those perished afternoons
is tired of not finding you. And now
a shadow falls on the soul.
Listen, brother, don't wait too long
to come out. All right? Mama might be worried.
Today no one has come to inquire,
nor have they wanted anything from me this afternoon.
I have not seen a single cemetery flower
in so happy a procession of lights.
Forgive me, Lord! I have died so little!
This afternoon everyone, everyone goes by
without asking or begging me anything.
And I do not know what it is they forget, and it is
heavy in my hands like something stolen.
I have come to the door,
and I want to shout at everyone:
—If you miss something, here it is!
Because in all the afternoons of this life,
I do not know how many doors are slammed on a face,
and my soul takes something that belongs to another.
Today nobody has come;
and today I have died so little in the afternoon!
In the end, at last, finally
I turn, I came back and wither, and I moan to you, giving you
the key, my hat, this letter for everyone.
At the end of the key lies the metal in which we learned
to ungild gold, and at the end
of my hat lies this poor badly combed brain,
and, a last glass of smoke, in its dramatic role,
lies this practical dream of the soul.
Goodbye, brother saint peters,
heraclituses, erasmuses, spinozas!
Goodbye, sad bolshevik priests!
Goodbye, rulers in disorder!
Goodbye, wine in water like wine!
Goodbye, alcohol in rain!
And goodbye also, I tell myself,
goodbye, formal flight of milligrams!
Goodbye as well, in the same way,
cold of cold and cold of warmth!
In the end, at last, finally, the logic,
the frontiers of the fire,
the farewell recalling that goodbye.
You rise, sparkling of lips and dark ringed eyes!
I rise through your veins, like a wounded mongrel
that seeks the refuge of soft, tender sidewalks.
Love, you are a sin in this world!
My kiss is the scintillating tip of the horn
of the devil: my kiss that is a sacred creed!
Spirit is the horopter of the eye that passes—
pure in its blasphemy!
the heart that engenders the brain!—
that passes into yours, by way of my sad clay.
Platonic stamen
that exists in the calyx where your soul exists!
Some penitent sinister quiet?
Perhaps you hear it! Innocent flower!
...And know where there is no Ourfather,
Love is a sinning Christ!
I come to see you each day,
enchanted steamer always distant...
Your eyes are two blonde captains;
your lip is the smallest red kerchief
waving a farewell of blood!
I come to see you pass; until one day,
intoxicated with time and cruelty,
enchanted steamer always distant,
the star of evening will be parting!
The rigging; winds that betray; the winds
of a woman who has passed!
Your cold captains will give their orders;
and it will be I who will have parted...
Moon! Crown of an ample brow,
unleafing in weld-coloured shades!
Red crown of a pondering Jesus
tragically mellow with emeralds!
Moon! Wild celestial heart,
why do you sail so, inside a cup
brimming with blue wine, westward,
your stern stricken and wrecked?
Moon! And trying in vain to fly,
in scattered opals you go up in flames:
you are perhaps my gypsy heart
that wanders in the blue — weeping verses!...
Like horrible amphibians into the atmosphere,
lugubrious grimaces rise to the lip.
Through the blue Sahara of Substance
journeys a grey verse, a dromedary.
A grimace of cruel dreams phosphoresces.
And the blind man who died full of the voices
of snow. And to rise early, poet, nomad,
to the cruelest day of being human.
The Hours go by, feverish, and in the corners
blond centuries of luck abort.
Who draws out so much thread; who mercilessly
lowers our nerves, cords
already frayed, to the tomb?
Love! And you, too. Black stonings
are engendered in your mask and break it.
Even the tomb is
the sex of a woman that attracts man!
Beloved, this night you have been crucified
on the two curving timbers of my kiss,
and your distress repeats how Jesus cried
and recalls a holy Friday sweeter than that kiss.
On this rare night your steady gaze has spied
Death singing in her bones from happiness
for this September night that's ratified
my second fall and all too human kiss.
Beloved, we will die together, close together;
this exalted bitterness will mellow as it dries
and Darkness turns our dead lips from one another.
Reproaches will no longer cloud your blessed eyes,
nor I again offend; instead we'll sleep together
in one single grave, like a little sister and brother.
Yes, the Soul grew afraid
at five o'clock on that faded blue afternoon.
The lip implored it between linens,
pouting like a bridegroom to his bride.
Thought, the great General, strapped
on the sword of deicide.
The Heart was dancing; but then sobbed:
was the enslaved dancer wounded?
Not at all! It was just the tigers brushing by
while racing to post themselves in that corner
to watch sadly the sunsets arriving from Athens.
There'll be no cure for this hospital of nerves —
great, irritated camp of this late afternoon!
And the General considers how to blow up the sinister pains
over there...
in the narrow defile of my nerves!
This afternoon it rains as never before; and I
don't feel like staying alive, heart.
This afternoon is sweet. Why shouldn't it be?
It's dressed in grace and sorrow, dressed like a woman.
This afternoon it's raining in Lima. And I remember
the cruel caverns of my ingratitude;
my chunk of ice on her poppy,
harsher than her 'Don't be like that.
My violent black flowers; the savage
outrageous lashing out; and the glacial distance.
And the silence of her dignity will brand
the final period with blazing oil.
That's why this afternoon, as never before, I walk
owl-like, with such a heart.
And others go by, and seeing me so sad,
they sense a little of you
in the craggy furrows of my deep misery.
This afternoon it rains and rains. And I
What is she doing now, my andean, sweet
Rita of the wild rushes and the wild grape;
now that Byzantium suffocates me, and my blood drowses,
like weak cognac, within me.
Where are her hands that used to contritely iron
in the afternoons, those whitenesses of the hereafter;
now, in this rain that takes away even
my desire to live.
What has become of her flannel skirt; of her
worries; of her way
of walking; of her savoring the sugar cane brandies of May.
She must be at the door watching some sign in the sky,
and finally, she'll say trembling..."Jesus, it's cold!"
And in the roof's thatched canes, a wild bird will cry.
It's an enormous spider that no longer walks,
a colorless spider, whose body,
a head and an abdomen, are bleeding.
Today I've watched her from up close. And with what effort
in all directions
she was stretching out her innumerable feet.
And I've been thinking of her invisible eys,
those fatal pilots of the spider.
It is a spider which was trembling, fixed
on a spur of rock;
the abdomen on one side,
and on the other the head.
With so many feet, poor thing, and still she can't
resolve it. And, on seeing her,
bewildered in such peril
today what sorrow she's given me, that traveler.
It's an enormous spider, held back
by the abdomen from following the head.
And I've been thinking of her eyes
and of her numerous feet...
And what sorrow she's given me, that traveler.
So life passes, like an odd mirage.
The blue rose that illuminates and gives being
to the thistle! United to the dogma of the killing
burden, the sophism of Good and of Reason!
What was grasped, by chance, has wounded the hand;
the perfumes took flight, and, among them, was sensed
the mold, that in mid-course, has grown
into the withered apple tree of the dead Illusion.
So life passes by,
with a parched bacchante's treacherous song of songs.
And, completely rattled, I go, onward....on,
muttering my funeral march.
They proceed at the feet of royal, brahmanical elephants,
and to the sordid droning of a mercurial fervor —
those couples who raise toasts sculpted of rock
and forgotten twilights, a cross to the lips.
So life passes by, vast orchestra of Sphinxes
that vomits its funeral march into the Void.
The day's about to come; wind up
your arm, look for yourself underneath
the mattress, turn and stand on
your head, in order to walk straight.
The day's about to come, put on your coat.
The day's about to come; grab
your gut tight in your hand, reflect
before you meditate, so it's awful
when misery overtakes you
and some tooth sinks down into you to the depths.
You have to eat, but I tell myself,
don't grieve, that's not for the poor,
grief and sobbing by the tomb;
patch yourself together, remember,
trust your white thread, smoke, check up
on your chain and hide it behind your portrait.
The day's about to come, put on your soul.
The day's about to come; they're going by,
they've opened up an eye in the hotel,
banging on it, flashing your mirror at it...
Are you trembling? It's the remote state of the forehead
and the recent nation of the stomach.
They're still snoring... What universe puts up with this snore?
The way your pores stay there, judging it!
With so many twos, ay, you're so alone!
The day's about to come, put on your dream.
The day's about to come, I repeat
through the oral organ of your silence
and the urge to turn left with hunger
and right with thirst; in any case
stop being poor with the rich,
stir up
your cold, because within it is mixed my warmth, beloved victim.
The day's about to come, put on you body.
The day's about to come;
the morning, the sea, the meteor, are going
after your exhaustion with banners,
and by your classic pride, the hyenas
count their steps to be in time with the ass,
the baker's wife is thinking of you,
the butcher is thinking of you, fingering
the hatchet in which are imprisoned
the steel and the iron and the metal; never forget
that during the Mass there are no friends.
The day's about to come, put on the sun.
The day is here; double
your breaths, triple
your rancorous goodwill
and give the elbow to fear, nix and exclamation point;
well, you, as your crotch shows, and being
a bad one, ay, immortal,
have dreamed this night that you were living
on nothing and dying from everything.
There are blows in life so heavy... I don't know!
Blows as if from the hatred of God; as if before them
the backwash of everything suffered
has welled up in the soul... I don't know!
They are few, but they exist... they open dark gashes
in the most ferocious countenance and in the strongest back.
It may be they are the colts of savage Attilas,
or the black riders sent to us by Death.
They are the deep backslidings of the Christs of the soul,
away from some precious faith blasphemed by Destiny.
Those bloody blows are the cracklings
of a loaf that burns up before us at the oven door.
And man... poor thing... poor thing! He rolls his eyes,
as when we're summoned by a clap on the shoulder.
He rolls his crazy eyes, and everything he's lived through
wells up, like a pool of guilt, in that gaze.
Sweet Hebrewess, unnail my clay transit;
unnail my nervous tension and my pain...
Unnail, eternal beloved, my long care and
the two nails of my wings and the nail of my love!
I am back from the desert where I often fell;
put away the hemlock and offer me your wines:
with a moan of love, frighten off my assassins,
whose features are Longinuss steadfast blindnesses!
Unnail my nails, O new mother of mine!
Symphony of olive-trees, pour out your weeping!
And you will wait, sitting near my dead flesh,
for the threat to yield, for the lark to be gone!
You pass... come back... your mourning braids my hair-cloth
with curare drops, ridges of humanity,
the rocky dignity that lies in your chastity,
and the judithian quicksilver of your inner honey.
Its eight in a charmer cream-coloured morning...
Its cold... A dog goes by gnawing the bone of another
dog that passed... And a match I extinguished
in capsules of silence begins to weep on my nerves!
And in my heretic soul a Dionysiac loathing of coffee
sings its sweet Asiatic festival...!
Beloved: you've never wanted to take the form
imagined by my divine love.
Remain in the host,
blind and impalpable,
as God exists.
If I've sung much, I've wept even more
for you! o my lofty parable of love!
Remain in the brain
and in the immense myth
of my heart!
It's faith, the forge where I fired
the earthy iron of so much woman;
and, on an ungodly anvil, desired to refine you.
Remain in nebulous
eternity, there
in the multisense of a sweet nonbeing.
And if you've never wanted to take the form
of my metaphysical emotion of love,
let me flog myself
as a sinner.
From all this I´m the only one who parts.
From this bench I´m off, from my breeches,
from my great situation, from my acts,
from my number split part to part,
from all this I´m the only one who parts.
From the Champs Élysées or as strange
little Moon Street turns around,
my defunction´s off, my cradle parts,
and surrounded by people, alone, loose,
my human resemblance turns around
sending out its shadows one by one.
And I remove from everything, for every
thing remains to make my alibi:
my shoe, its buttonhole, likewise its mud-
even the double in the elbow
of my own shirt buttoned up.
Father dust, who rises up from Spain,
may God save you, liberate and crown you,
Father dust ascending from the soul.
Father dust who rises from the fire,
may God save, uphold and give you a throne,
Father dust who art in heaven.
Father dust, great-grandson of the smoke,
may God save and raise you to the infinite,
Father dust, great-grandson of the smoke.
Father dust, where the just come to an end,
may God save and restore you to the earth,
Father dust, where the just come to an end.
Father dust, who branches into palms,
may God save and look into your heart,
Father dust, terror of the void.
Father dust, composed of iron,
may God save and give you human form,
Father dust who marches burning.
Father dust, sandal of the Pariah,
may God save and never unbind you,
Father dust, sandal of the Pariah.
Father dust, winnowed by the savage,
may God save and gird you with minor gods
Father dust, escorted by atoms.
Father dust, death-veil of the village,
may God save you from evil forever,
Father dust of Spain, our own father.
Father dust, who goes toward the future,
may God save and guide you, give you wings,
Father dust, who goes toward the future.
I feel good. Now
a stoic cold radiates
within me.
This ruby-red rope that rasps
inside my body makes me
laugh.
Endless rope
like a
spiral
descending
from
evil...
Bloody, left-handed rope
formed by
a thousand daggers driven in.
So let it unravel, braiding
its bolts of funereal cloth,
and let it leash the trembling cat
to the frozen den,
the final hearth.
Now I am serene,
with light.
And on my Pacific
a shipwrecked coffin mews.
And at last, moving on to death's dominion,
that acts in squadron, foregoing bracket,
and paragraph and brace, big hand and dieresis;
— why the Assyrian dais? Why the Christian pulpit,
the ardent ramrod of vandal furniture
or even less, this gravest retirement?
Is it to end up,
tomorrow, in prototype of phallic display,
in diabetes and in white bedpan,
in geometrical face, in defunct,
that one needs a sermon and almonds,
that there are literally potatoes to spare
and this fluvial spectre in which gold burns
and in which the price of snow burns up?
Is it for this we die so much?
Do we have to die each instant
just to die?
And the paragraph I'm writing?
And the deistic bracket I'm hoisting?
And the squadron in which my helmet failed?
And the key that fits in every door?
And the forensic dieresis, the hand,
my potato, my flesh and, under the sheets, my contradiction?
My lunacy, my wolfness, my lambness,
my rational horseness!
Dais, yes, my whole life; pulpit,
also, my whole death!
Sermon of barbarism: these pages;
gravest retirement: this slough.
In this manner, pensive, auriferous, armful,
in two moments I will defend my prey
with my voice and also with my larynx,
and of the physical smell I pray with,
and of the instinct for immobility I walk with,
I will honour myself as long as I live — it has to be said;
and my botflies will engorge with pride
for I'm at the centre, and on the right
as well, and on the left, just the same.
Alfonso, you're watching me, I see it,
from that implacable plane, the dwelling place
of forevers and nevers lined up row by row.
(That night you slept, between your dream
and my dream, in the rue de Ribouté)
Palpably,
your unforgettable halfbreed hears you strolling
through Paris, senses you on the phone becoming silent
and picks up, on the wire, your latest act
taking shape, a toast
from the depths, by me, by you.
I'm still
buying "du vin, du lait, comptant les sous"
under my overcoat, so that my soul doesn't see me
under that same overcoat, dear Alfonso
and under the simple beam of the compound temple;
I still suffer but you, no more, never, brother!
(They've told me that in your centuries of pain,
beloved being,
beloved existing,
you made zeros of wood. Is it true?)
In the "boite du nuit" where you used to play tangos,
your indignant protege touched to the heart,
leading yourself, weeping
for yourself and for your enormous resemblance to your shadow,
Monsieur Fourgat, the owner, has grown older.
Tell him about it? Recount it to him? No more,
Alfonso; that's over now.
The Hotel des Ecoles is always open
and they still buy tangerines;
but I suffer, like I tell you,
sweetly, remembering
what we suffered together, at both our deaths
in the opening of the double tomb,
of that other tomb with your being,
and this mahogany one with your existence;
I suffer, drinking a glass of you, Silva,
a little pick-me-up, as we used to say,
and afterwards, well, we'll see what happens.
This is the other toast, among three
taciturn, diverse
in drink, in the world, in glass, how we drank
more than once to the body
and less than once to the mind.
Today is even more different,
today I suffer sweet, bitterly,
I drink your blood on behalf of Christ the firm
I eat your bone on behalf of Christ the yielding,
because I love you, two by two, Alfonso,
and I could almost say, eternally.
Day breaks raining. Combed through
morning drips fine hair.
Melancholy is lashed fast;
and on the misasphalted oxident of Hindu furniture
veering, destiny hardly settles.
Skies of the puna disheartened
by great love, platinum skies, torvous
with impossibility.
The flock ruminates and is underscored
by an Andean whinny.
I remember myself. But the staves
of the wind suffice, the rudders so still
they appear one,
and the cricket of tedium and jibbous unbreakable elbow.
The morning suffices with loose tresses
of precious, sierran tar,
when I go out and look for eleven o'clock
and it is only an untimely twelve.
The highest points craterized, the points
of love, of capital being, I drink, I fast, I ab-
sorb heroin for the sorrow, for the languid
throb and against all correction.
Can I say that they've betrayed us? No.
That all were good? Neither. But
good will exist there, no doubt,
and above all, being so.
And so what who loves himself so! I seek myself
in my own design which was to be a work
of mine, in vain: nothing managed to be free.
And yet, who pushes me.
I bet I don't dare shut the fifth window.
And the role of loving oneself and persisting, close to the
hours and to what is undue.
And this and that.
The accent hangs down from my shoe;
I hear it perfectly
yield, blaze, bend to the shape of amber
and hang down, colouring, a bad shade.
Thus, I have outgrown my size,
judges watch me from a tree
with their backs they watch me walk ahead,
go inside my hammer,
stand to look at a girl
and, at the foot of a urinal, raise my shoulders.
Surely there's no one at my side,
it matters little, I don't need them;
surely they have dismissed me:
I feel it distinctly.
Praying is the cruellest size!
Humiliation, brilliance, deep jungle!
I've size to spare, extendable fog,
speed above and from and close up.
Imperturbable! Imperturbable! Afterwards,
fatidic telephones are ringing.
It's the accent itself.
In that corner where we slept together
so many nights, I've sat down now
to wander. The bedstead of the defunct lovers
was taken out, or — who knows what happened?
You've come early on other business
and now you're no longer here. It's the corner
where, by your side, I read one night
between your tender breasts
a story by Daudet. It's the corner
we loved. Don't mistake it.
I've begun to remember those lost
days of summer, your comings and goings,
little and fed up and pale through the rooms.
On this drenching night,
already far from us both, I jump up suddenly...
It's two doors opening, closing,
two doors that come and go in the wind
shadow to shadow.
Tonight I get down from my horse
by the front door of the house, where
I waved goodbye as the rooster crowed.
It's locked and no one answers.
The bench where Mama showed
my older brother how to saddle
backs I'd ridden bare
along the roads and fields, village kid;
the bench where I left , to yellow in the sun,
my painful childhood... and that pain
that frames the doorway?
A deity in the strange peace,
the beast, as though calling too, sneezes
and sniffs, stamping the paving-stone. Then, doubtful,
he whinnies
with a lively shake of his ears.
Papa must be praying late, and perhaps
he'll think it's I who've kept him up.
My sisters, buzzing with their fantasies,
simple and bubbling over
with plans for the party coming soon,
and now almost nothing is missing.
I wait, I wait, my heart
an egg about to hatch, past its time.
Numerous family we left
not long ago, now no one keeps watch, not even a candle
set in the niche for our safe return.
I call again, and nothing.
We fall silent and begin to sob, and the animal
whinnies, whinnies again.
They're all sleeping forever,
and so much the better, since finally
my horse begins to nod from drowsiness
in his turn and between naps at every bobbing says
that it's all right, everything's quite all right.
It hails so much, as if to make me recall
and increase the pearls
that I've gathered from the very snout
of every storm.
May this rain not dry up.
Unless I am permitted
to fall now for it, or unless they bury me
drenched in the water
that would surge from all fires.
This rain, how far will it reach me?
I'm afraid I'm left with one flank dry;
afraid that it's ending, without having tested me
in droughts of incredible vocal cords,
by which,
to create harmony,
one must always rise--never descend!
Don't we rise in fact downward?
Sing, rain, on the coast still without sea!
Another alas has triumphed. There lies the truth.
And whoever acts so, won't he really know
how to train excellent digitigrades
for the mouse Yes... No... ?
Another alas has triumphed and against no one.
Oh exosmosis of chemically pure water.
Ah southwinds of mine. Oh our divines.
I have the right then
to be green and content and dangerous, and to be
the chisel, the fear of the crude coarse block;
to put my foot in it, and to laughter.
Absurd, only you are pure.
Absurd, only before you does this excess
sweat with golden pleasure.
The terrestrial sphere of love
that lagged below, turns round
and round without stopping a second,
and we are condemned to suffer,
as a centre, its rotation.
Motionless Pacific, glass, pregnant
with every possibility.
Cold Andes, inhumanable, pure.
Perhaps. Perhaps.
The sphere spins on the flint of time,
and sharpens,
sharpens till it wants to lose itself;
it spins forging, before the deserted flanks,
that point so frighteningly known,
because it has gestated, turn
and turn again,
the familiar little corral.
Centrifugal it goes yes, yes,
Yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes: NO!
And I withdraw till blue, and retreating
grow hard, until I clutch my soul!
The grownups
What time are they coming back?
Blind Santiago is tolling six
and it's already very dark.
Mother said she wouldn't be long.
Aguedita, Nativa, Miguel,
be careful going by there, where
doubled-over griefs
snuffling their memories have just passed by
toward the silent barnyard, and where
the hens are only now settling down
they were so scared.
We'd better stay right here.
We shouldn't be upset. Let's go see
the boats - mine's the prettiest of all —
that we play with the whole blessed day
without fighting, as it should be:
they're still in the puddle, ready
with a cargo of good things for tomorrow.
Let's wait like this, obedient, since there's
no choice, for the return, the excuses
of the grownups, always the first
to leave us little ones at home
as though we too
couldn't go away.
Aguedita, Nativa, Miguel?
I am calling, I'm groping around in the darkness.
You can't have left me here alone,
and the only one shut in is me.
Slow room in bittered, they closed you, I closed you,
still wanting you, you know it,
and today from whose hands will your keys hang.
From these walls we demolish the last
few pavilions that were singing.
The foliage has grown. I see peasants working,
their backs loaded with success.
And the elapsed month and a half are enough
for one shroud, even too much.
Room with four entrances and no exit,
today you have the blues, I speak to you
in all your six dialects.
Now I won't have to violate what you are to me,
never; now we will not breach
any other beloved door.
July was, then, the ninth month. Love
told an odd sound. And the sweetness
gave to every shroud, even too much.
Mother, tomorrow I'm off to Santiago
to drench myself in your blessing and in your lament.
I am arranging my disillusions and the sore's
pink of my false bustling.
Your arch of surprise will wait for me,
the tonsured columns of your life-wasting 
longings. The patio will wait for me,
the hallway downstairs with its moldings and festive
ornaments. My tutor armchair will wait for me, 
that good big-jawed furniture of dynastic
leather, that does nothing but grumble at the great-
great-grandchild buttocks, from strap to little strap.
I am sifting my purest affections,
I'm axising, Can't you hear the plummet panting?
Can't you hear the reveilles straining?
I am shaping your formula of love
for all the hollows of this soil.
Oh if all the silent wheels were disposed
to all the most distant ribbons,
to all the most different dates.
Thus, dead immortal. Thus.
Under the double arches of your blood, through
which one must pass so stealthily, that even my father
to go through there,
humbled himself down to less than half-man,
until being the first child you had.
Thus, dead immortal.
Between the colonnade of your bones
that even a sob cannot tumble down,
and into whose side not even Destiny
could intrude a single finger of his.
Thus.
A lie! So I did it to trick you,
that's all. There it is. Anyway,
even you are going to see
how sorry I'll be for having been like that.
It's a lie! Hush!
It's over now.
Just like sometimes you've done the same to me,
that's why I did it.
Me, the way I snooped to make sure you really
were crying,
since there were other times you only kept on
sniveling to look sweet.
Me, who never dreamed you'd believe those things,
your tears won me over.
That's it.
So now you know: the whole thing was a lie.
And if you keep on crying, all right for you!
Next time I won't even see you when you're playing.
Oh the cell's four walls.
Ah the four whitish walls
yielding ever the same result.
Cradle of nerves, fateful breach,
how day after day, with its four corners
it tears apart the fettered limbs.
Loving wardess with countless keys,
were you here, could you see to what
late hour these walls are four.
Up against them, with you, we both
would be two, more two than ever. Nor would you cry,
right, rescuer!
Ah the cell's walls.
Of these I ache, meanwhile, more
from the two long ones which tonight
evoke mothers long dead
leading down bromided slopes,
each a child by the hand.
And only I am left behind
with a right hand that works for both,
raised, on the look out for a tertiary arm
that between my where and my when
may pupil this disabled maturity of manhood.
I'm thinking of your sex.
My heart simplified, I'm thinking of your sex,
faced with the ripe flank of the day.
I stroke your bud of pleasure, it's in season.
And an old feeling dies,
degenerated in brains.
I'm thinking of your sex, furrow more prolific
and harmonious than the womb of Darkness,
though Death conceives and brings forth
from God himself...
Oh, Conscience!
I'm thinking, yes, of the free beast
rutting where he pleases, wherever he can.
Oh, honeyed scandal of twilights,
Oh, mute outcry.
Odumodneurtse!
Second degree burn
in all the tender swelling of desire,
prickling of that vagrant chile pepper
at two in the immoral afternoon.
Gauntlet of the borders verge to verge.
Fragrant truth captured alive, connecting up
the antenna of sex
with what we are being without knowing it.
Overflow of the ultimate ablution.
Traveling cauldrons
that collide and spatter with fresh shade
unanimous, the color, the fraction, the hard life,
the hard eternal life.
Let's not be afraid. Death is like this.
The sex blood of the beloved who moans
sugarsweet, from bearing so much
on such a ridiculous point.
And the circuit
linking our poor day and the grand night,
Who lit the match!
I'm swaying. I smile
swinging justified.
I smile even more, if everyone comes
to see the colourless guides
and me always on time. I don't care.
And that good Sun who, dying of pleasure,
cuts everything up to distribute it
among shadows, the prodigal,
not even he would wait for me on the other side.
Nor the rest who keep only
entering and leaving.
The great baker calls
with tolling retinas. And we pay in gestures
most curious the warm irrefutable value
baked, transcendent.
And we have coffee, already late,
with deficient sugar that's been lacking,
and butterless bread. What can we do.
But, nonetheless, the rings regirded, barred.
Health walks on one foot. Forward: march!
Wanna giback stroke for stroke
Her two broad leaves, her valve
opening in succulent reception
of muliplicand to multiplier,
her condition excellent for pleasure,
the whole been truth
Want to giback stroke for stroke.
She murmurs and I lay on bolivarian peaks
for thirty-two furlongs and their multiples
hair by hair she tightens
Lady Blubberlips, an Ouevre in two parts
till I can't live without
or with that touching.
Can't giback stroke for stroke.
We'll never saddle that bull-y. I dribble
from egoism and that mortal friction
of sheets
since the woman is
— how heavy she's become!
And female is the soul of the absent one.
And female is my soul.
When I pause to contemplate my circumstance,
and look back on the road I have traversed,
I find, to judge by where I have been lost,
that I might well have ended up far worse;
but then if I forget about the road,
I don't know how I've reached such misery;
I know I die, and all the more regret
the knowledge that my love will die with me.
And die I shall, for yielding artlessly
to one who easily could end my life
if that's what she desires, which may prove true;
for since my will can bring about my death,
her will, which is not so much on my side,
since it can, what else would it likely do?
Over rough roads I've come here
from where for fear I cannot move;
if I try to move or take a pace
at once I'm dragged back by the hair.
But I am one who with death at my side
now seek new counsel from my life;
I know the best but agree to the worst
from my bad habits, or maybe my fate.
Moreover the short time that I have
and the misguided course of my years
in their beginnings and at their height,
my desires that I do not resist,
my certain death, the end of these ills
make me neglect my remedy.
My lady, if I now bereft of you
in this life carry on and do not die,
it seems to me that I offend my love,
and all the joy I held being alive.
But then I must regard the other side,
which is that if of my life I despair
I lose whatever joy from you I'd gain,
and thus of reversed feelings I'm aware.
In this reversal all my faculties
reside now in your absence and in strife.
I don't know what to do in such a state.
They come together only to wage war:
and thus they battle on both night and day,
for hurting me's their only common trait.
Oh, sweet tokens, sadly found by me,
sweet and happy when God willed it so!
Together with my memory you go,
making my death your conspiracy.
Who ever could have told me, having seen
the joy you brought to me not long ago,
that, in time, I would come to know
you as the source of my great suffering?
As in one hour you have laid to waste
all the good you gave me by degrees,
so take away the ill you left, with haste;
if not, I will suspect that it would please
you to let me know your bounty's taste
then watch me die among sad memories.
Beautiful nymphs who through the river pass,
living in contentment on your own
in your mansions built of shimmering stone
and upheld by columns made of glass:
now, one embroiders lovely trifles as
another weaves a cloth of delicate tone;
and now, a few of you go off alone,
each telling of the life and loves she has;
for a while, put your work aside
and lift your golden heads to look at me,
and I won't keep you long, I confide;
you'll be too sad to listen, or I'll be
changed to water crying at your side,
and then there will be time for sympathy.
If trying to hold back this crazy, vain,
impossible and frightening desire,
and if to hide from danger so intense,
convincing myself of what I can't see,
it does not help to see me as I am,
sometimes courageous, sometimes racked with fear,
in such confusion that I never dare
to guard against the evil deep in me,
how could it help to see the painting of
the famous youth who with his melted wings
in falling, to a sea his name bestowed,
and one of him, whose own madness and fire
he must lament beneath those fabled trees,
and even in the water can't grow cold.
Strange icy throes the arms of Daphne bind,
Which shoot, and spread, and lengthen into boughs;
And into green leaves metamorphosed shows
The head whose locks, wooed by the summer wind,
Made the fine gold seem dim; the rigorous rind
Clothes the soft members that still pant; her feet,
Snowy as swift, in earth fast rooted meet,
By thousand tortuous fibres intertwined.
The author of an injury so great,
With virtue of his tears this laurel fed,
Which flourished thus, perpetual greenness keeping;
Oh fatal growth! oh miserable estate !
That from his weeping each fresh day should spread
The very cause and reason of his weeping.
Just like the doting mother whose infirm
young child with bitter tears keeps begging for
some thing, which once he's done with eating it
she realizes will make him suffer more,
and her devoted love will not allow
her to consider that she will increase
the harm by doing it, and she gives in,
and more he suffers, though his tears do cease:
I likewise, when my fevered, witless mind,
which to its own harm begs for you, should want
to keep from it this fatal nourishment,
but still it begs, and every day is spent
in tears, so everything it wants I grant,
forgetting that both it and I will end.
If I am wax submitting to your will,
and take only your eyes to be the sun,
which anyone their glance does not ignite
or conquer, must be to all senses numb;
from which I can deduce that if I were
of seeing them and feeling them relieved,
as it appears that reason they resist,
my very senses I would not believe,
for I am from afar engulfed in flames
by your impassioned gaze, and I am so
burned up that my life is but scarce maintained.
But if from closer up I am attacked
by your eyes, then I feel, in frozen state
my very blood congeal within my veins.
So long as of red rose and lily white
the proper colors of your face now show,
and your impassioned, fervent, honest glance
inflames the heart and holds it close in tow;
and so long as your hair, which in a vein
of gold was mined, endowed with rapid flight,
around your lovely white, and haughty throat
the wind can still move, scatter, and uncomb;
go, pluck now from the spring of your delight
the sweetest fruit, before the angry years
can wrap the lovely peak in snowy scenes.
The icy wind will cause the rose to wilt,
and all things will be changed by fickle time,
so as to never change its own routine.
As resolute Leander crossed the sea,
entirely consumed by flames of love,
the wind picked up, and started then to swell
the water's current with a raging shove.
Worn out by all his effort's sudden strain,
to overcome the waves so ill-prepared,
and rather of the joy, in death, he'd lose
than of his own life feeling deep despair,
he raised as best he could his weary voice
and to the waves spoke out as follows here,
though never did they hear his cry of strife:
"Waves, since now I know that I must die,
just let me get there, and when I return
your rage may take its toll upon my life."
Within a valley's entrance, in a desert,
Where none pass through nor leave this barren setting,
I saw, though strange it seemed, a dog was fretting;
In pain he cried, in agony bewildered,
To open skies he hurls his dirge untethered,
And now along the path he tracks, retreading;
He ambles on, he turns, he stops, and yet he
Retains the ashen pallor of cadavers.
And this because his master left his presence;
He cannot find his master, this he senses;
Behold how far the reach of painful absence.
To see his hardship moved me to compassion;
In pity I exhorted him: Have patience,
For I can fathom reason and am absent.
Night, you fabricator of deceptions,
insane, fantastic, and chimerical,
who show those who derive delight from you
the mountains flattened and the seas gone dry;
inhabitor of hollow, empty brains,
mechanic, alchemist, philosopher,
a vile concealer, lynx that cannot see,
you are of your own echoes terrified:
darkness, fear, and evil are your works,
cautious, poetess, infirm and cold,
with ruffian's hands and feet of fugitive.
Whether I sleep or wake, half my life's yours:
if I'm awake, I pay you the next day,
and if I sleep, I sense not what I live.
From bed down to the floor all bloody hangs
the right shoulder of the merciless lord,
who storming futilely Bethulia's wall,
hurled bolts against himself towards heaven's hold.
In agony entangled, the red veil
of the pavilion, on the lefthand side,
reveals the cruel, inhuman spectacle
of his hideous trunk, now icy cold.
Spilled Bacchus stains his sturdy coat of mail,
the glasses and the table overturned;
the guards sleep, who stand him in such poor stead;
and there, atop the jagged city wall
of Israel's tribe, the Hebrew woman chaste
appears resplendent, brandishing his head.
Take that bridge off me, for it's killing me,
Your Honors, councilmembers of this town;
I tell you it has cracked one of my ribs;
it's too big, and it's such a heavy load!
From arch to arch it is spread out so far,
that even my green shore cannot quite see it;
I'd rather that they take it to Seville,
if it could fit across her river's road.
Perishing from thirst in summer's heat,
it's wrong to give the cause and argument
that in a storm, at least, I pass the test.
Since with just half of it I'd be content,
your mercies, bring another river here
to serve it as a second, paying guest.
I am astonished that so lost a man
the error of his ways could recognize.
When I look back upon the years I've spent
forgetful then of all reason divine,
I see that it has been by heaven's grace
that into evil's pit I did not slide.
I entered through so strange a labyrinth,
trusting that the weak thread of my life
would let me see, though late, my own confusion;
but by Your light my darkness overcome,
the monster slain of my blind self-deceit,
lost reason comes home for its apt conclusion.
He knows not what love is who doesn't love you,
oh, celestial beauty, bridegroom fair;
your head is of pure gold, your flowing hair
like crowns that palm fronds cover totally;
your mouth is like a lily, from which spills
sweet liquor at dawn; ivory your neck;
your hand the wheel, and on its palm the seal,
which souls call hyacinths for secrecy.
My God, what thought I when, leaving behind
such beauty, and just mortal grace could see,
I lost what might have been my greatest joy?
But if the time I've lost disturbs me now,
I shall make haste, so that one hour of love
the years I've spent pretending will destroy.
Shepherd, who with loving whistled notes
awakened me from the profoundest sleep;
you, who made a crook out of that wood
and now extend your powerful arms there:
turn your eyes with mercy on my faith,
for I confess that you're my love and lord
and pledge to you my word that I'll pursue
your gentle whistles and your feet so fair.
Listen, Shepherd, since you die for love,
don't take fright at the rigor of my sins,
since you're a friend of those crushed by defeat.
Wait, then, and listen closely to my woes—
But surely I need not tell you to wait
since wait you must while nails restrain your feet.
Lord, what am I, that with unceasing care
Thou did'st seek after me, that Thou did'st wait
Wet with unhealthy dews before my gate,
And pass the gloomy nights of winter there?
Oh, strange delusion, that I did not greet
Thy blest approach, and oh, to heaven how lost
If my ingratitude's unkindly frost
Has chilled the bleeding wounds upon Thy feet.
How oft my guardian angel gently cried,
"Soul, from thy casement look, and thou shalt see
How He persists to knock and wait for thee!"
And oh, how often to that Voice of sorrow,
"Tomorrow we will open," I replied,
And when the morrow came I answered still "Tomorrow."
Free my gentle lamb, shepherd unknown,
for you've another that is more like you;
let go the creature that my soul adores,
whose loss you celebrate and I must rue.
Put back on her the bell of well-wrought tin,
and don't deceive her with your chains of gold;
accept for all your troubles this white bull
which when spring comes will be just one year old.
If you require description, she's got fleece
that's brown and curly, and her little eyes
look like she just woke up, as there she stands.
If you think, Alsino, she's not mine,
just let her go and see her find my hut:
her owner's still got salt upon his hands.
Poetry of love, scattered conceits
engendered by my soul upon my woes,
delivered of my smoldering senses' womb,
and with more pain than freedom surely born;
abandoned to the world, in which so lost,
so battered and transformed you wandered free
that only in the place you were conceived
would you by your own blood ever be known:
for since you steal the labyrinth from Crete,
from Dedalus his grandly soaring thoughts,
from sea the fury, from the abyss its fire,
if that exquisite asp won't take you in,
depart the earth, go entertain the winds,
and thus to your true home you shall retire.
The glorious palm tree drops its leafy fronds
and without love wears sterile mourning clothes;
Daphne in barren laurel tree complains,
Narcissus in white petals sheds his soul.
The earth without rain finds itself becalmed,
a dried-up field rank weeds can only grow;
because she never paid tribute to love,
Anaxarete's soul cries within its stone.
The love of sand and water gold engenders;
since oysters are enamored of the dew,
they can with oriental pearls be filled.
So do not scorn my love, Lucinda fair,
for when the sun goes down, the lilies soon
will lose their luster and our life its thrill.
What have you done, tell me, horrible sea,
with that sweet love of mine?
How could you have snatched away
my beloved with all your furor?
His fragile little boat
set sail from this shore;
where now goes its keel?
Never more will it return!
Great God, relieve the harshness
of this cruel bitterness of mine;
cease the fatal severity
of so much misfortune.
But, O God, you that know,
am I wrong in what I think?
Ah, fatal sea that you are.
Is it madness to doubt
this feeling of despair
that will be the end of me?
That happy little boat,
ah, never more will your keel
touch upon the sand
of this beloved shore!
Ah, my unfortunate child,
fruit of love and pain,
an orphan you have become.
Ah, never more, my little delight,
will your baby cheek enjoy
that sweet paternal kiss,
Ah, all is done¦all is dead!
Unhappy little boat¦
What have you done, tell me, horrible sea¦
Full of grace exceedingly,
As she hath charm and loveliness;
Speak, O sailor of the sea,
And from out thy bark, confess
That never ship nor sail can be
Beautiful as she.
Speak, thou knightly man-at-arms,
Boasting of thy panoply,—
Are horse or sword or war-alarms
Beautiful as she?
Speak, thou shepherd of the hills,
Where thine idle flocks are free,—
Are there peaks or vales or rills
Garden of Hesperides, divine
And golden garden shining in mine eyes,
Dream or reality? what paths shall twine
Unto thy shores, O Paradise of mine?
So to his dream the pilgrim makes repine
Falling in mire and blood amid his sighs.
To seek this garden destiny is thine,
But never shalt behold it anywise.
Never to see it, for it lives alone
Within the bosoms that have sorrow known,
The treasure-house of all their fantasy
In vain thine arid eye its gates would find;
The prose of life is all too near the mind,
And far too far away is Poesy!
Love is an anguish, a question,
a luminous doubt suspended;
it is a desire to know the whole of you
and a fear of finally knowing it.
To love is to reconstruct, when you are away,
your steps, your silences, your words,
and to pretend to follow your thoughts
when unmoving at last by me side, you fall silent.
Love is a secret rage,
an icy and diabolic pride.
To love is not to sleep when in my bed
you dream between my circling arms,
and to hate the dream in which, beneath your brow,
you abandon yourself, perhaps in other arms.
To love is to listen at your breast,
until my greedy ear is glutted,
to the noise of your blood and the tide
of your measured breath.
To love is to absord you young sap
and join our mouths in one river-bed
until the breeze of your breath
impregnates my entrails forever.
Love is a mute, green envy,
a subtle and shining greed.
To love is to provoke the sweet moment
in which your skin seekd my awakened skin,
to gratify the nocturnal appetite
and to die once more the same death—
provisional, heart-rending, dark.
Love is a thirst, like that of a wound
that burns without being consumed or healing,
and the hunger of a tormented mouth
that begs for more and more and is not sated.
Love is an unaccustomed luxury
and a voracious gluttony, always empty.
But to love is also to close our eyes,
to let sleep invade our bodies
like a river of darkness and oblivion,
and to sail without a course, drifting;
because love, in the end, is indolence.
Death always takes the shape
of our bedroom.
It is concave and dark, silent and warm,
it gathers in the curtains where the shadows take shelter,
it is hard in the mirror and icy and tense,
deep in the pillows, white in the sheets.
We both know that death takes the shape
of our bedroom, and that in the bedroom
there's a cold space that erects
a wall, a crystal, a silence between us.
Then, only I know that death
is the hollow you leave in our bed
when suddenly, for no reason,
you sit up or you stand.
And it is the crackling of burning leaves
your bare feet make across the rug.
And it is the sweat that wets our thighs
that lock and struggle and then surrender.
And it is the sentence you interrupt and let drop.
And in my question you don't hear,
you don't understand, you don't answer.
And the silence that falls and entombs you
as I watch over your sleep and wonder.
And I, only I know that death
is the choked words, the strange groans
and the obscure involuntary movements you make
when you wrestle the angel of sleep in your sleep.
Death is all this and more that encircles us,
and brings us together, pulls us apart,
and finally leaves us confused, startled, hanging,
with a wound that doesn't bleed.
Then, only then, both of us alone know
that it is not love, but darkened death
that makes us look, face and face in each other's eyes,
and reach and come together, more than alone and stranded,
still more, and each time more, even still.
In the middle of a silence deserted as a street before a crime
not even breathing so that nothing will disturb my dying
in this loneliness with no walls
at this hour when angles are escaping 
I leave my bloodless statue in the tomb of my bed
and go off in the slow-moving moment
in the interminable descent
with no arms to stretch out
with no fingers to reach the scale falling from an invisible piano
with nothing more than a glance and a voice
that cant remember having left their eyes and lips
what are lips? What are glances that are lips?
and my voice is no longer my voice
within this unwetting water
within this plate glass air
within this purple fire that slashes like a scream
In the miserable game of mirror to mirror
my voice is falling
and my voice incinerates
and my voice in sin narrates
and my voice in sin elates
and my poison scintillates
like plate glass ice
like the screams of ice
here in the shell of my ear
the pounding of a sea where I get nothing
wet nothing
for Ive left my arms and feet on shore
and I feel the net of my nerves being cast outside me
and everything escapes like a calculating fish
counting to a hundred in the pulse in my temples
a dead telegraph no one is answering
for sleep and death have nothing more to say.
Thou gracious dweller of the woodland green,
Companion ever of the April flowers,
And living breath of mother Venuss heart,
O gentle zephyr!—
If thou dost know the sorrows of my love,—
Thou that dost bear afar my sad lament,—
Hear me and frankly say to her I love
That here I perish!
Filis, who once my bitter yearnings knew,
Filis, who once my bitter yearnings wept,
Once did she love me, but, alas, I fear,
I fear her anger!
So do the gods with their paternal breasts,
Sodo the heavens with all their hearts benign
Withdraw themselves, what time thy gladsome wing
The snows uncover;
Never the dark clouds burden, at the break
Of morn along the lofty mountain chain,
Bruises thy shoulders, nor their bitter hail
Shatters thy pinions!
'Tis sweet in the green spring,
To gaze upon the wakening fields around;
Birds in the thicket sing,
Winds whisper, waters prattle from the ground;
A thousand odors rise,
Breathed up from blossoms of a thousand dies.
Shadowy and close and cool,
The pine and poplar keep their quiet nook;
Forever fresh and full,
Shines, at their feet, the thirst-inviting brook;
And the soft herbage seems
Spread for a place of banquets and of dreams.
Thou , who alone art fair,
And whom alone I love, art far away.
Unless thy smile be there,
It makes me sad to see the earth so gay;
I care not if the train
Of leaves, and flowers, and zephyrs go again.
To lose is the most noble gesture in life.
But let's not kid ourselves. Only he who had, loses.
To lose is for that reason winning twice. The disdain
of now and the dazzling flattery of before.
To accept destitution after gold. To take pleasure
in being a nobody, having been rich. Getting rid of everything.
To taste the mud with a prince's palate.
(Sterile artists or exiled kings).
But the real loser is not the one who looks for it,
but the one who accpts —truly— his destiny.
Shows off what is not his. And alcoholic
and prematurely gray is in debt like the young lords
of century ago. From buying diamonds and horses...
The loser doesn't want to know about all he would have loved
(he already has signed that book with ennui).
To lose is to be another and to be the same. And to live
at the end the rending tear of the flesh that ennobles
and defiles. To lose is the ultimate act of dandyism.
His body wrapped in a blue overcoat, extra wide;
his tie neatly tied, and his hair tousled by the
afternoon wind, the man strolls alone, through a gray city,
picking at the pale cigarettes and wax matches in his pockets.
He takes a seat in the cafes, and drinks much; maybe reads
a newspaper without interest, while he glances around and ideas prowl about him
strange ones almost always. He speaks, perhaps, with someone, for a moment,
but his forced smile seems missing. He leaves suddenly,
and walking, arrives at taverns or clubs of a lower order,
where again he drinks, and soon in the midst of lewd music
is intoxicated by an immature skin that doesn't strain the eyes.
(Sweet flowered body, soft beginning where grace resides).
Later a few words. And half-hidden dates, now or tomorrow.
Just at night fall; with too much alcohol and tobacco smoke
clinging to his hands, he will open the door to a cold floor,
hesitant, with books and papers in disarray and empty bottles.
And there, tumbled onto a sofa before falling asleep—listening to the violas
of Rameau in the air—that man alone with feel the tears run down.
He has seen approaching him at last (today too) the impossible Angel that will save him.
Some time (it was certain) we were going to meet
face to face. For on that solitary night
I was weeping remembering your image. For in you
life does not seem dangerous to me, and the love
I have for you —like the very truest— can never be named.
It is also quite certain that at other times I would have
wanted to lose you completely or to feel you at least,
kind and distant. But you know how much I need you
and that I dream of us together, like extravagant birds
in luxurious salons. There were (I recall) journeys we shared,
once again frustrating and sweet, like an old love.
I don't know what to call you. And If I love forms and beauty,
it is perhaps because you block any other passion.
You are the ground, the humus of the earth, the homeland
that transcends your hands, a heated ooze,
abyss of sensitive matter. And yet
I would wish, with that, your eyes forever, the sound of your voice
so well defined, the names you tell me when you thirst
is delirious, and your immense tenderness, your profound affection as of
fire, while I touch your nails and your hair and I know you as you:
Marvelous being exactly whose arms embrace me and take care of me.
I would like to invite you one night (and still hope to)
for a chat, so they may see you, and for a drink together.
(Because it is thrilling to speak beside a body so lovely
and young, and to llok upon it with delight, unhurried, so that they will believe it is yours).
And when the waiter bring us the goblet, exuberant,
grateful, and overwhelmed by some liquor among the ice and gold,
in the intimate and brilliant light of the lamps, Vitucho,
I would say to you: Do you see it? The crystal shines, and the liquor overflows.
After a short time, still in the middle of the night, it would be empty
and dirty. The fingerprints impressed on the glass. Gone.
And I will say to you that your adolescence is, now, like that
over-flowing goblet. I would say it to you, and would look at you and hope you understood
The sun of Palermo after so many trips,
the cold flavor of Pernod on an open balcony...
And to continue, continue through a comfortable winter.
But the monologue with oneself bores
—even though often it may be necessary—
and loneliness is not only knowing one is alone.
It is like a well that never ends,
an old movie that makes you see interminably.
The sheer conviction (there's no lack of arguments)
that everything is useless and all is tottering...
That to live is only to have lived, and is now a lie.
Neither the portentous light that envelops the palm trees,
nor the Sicilian sea like a mineral, moving,
nor the bodies that offer passion after the flowers...
Nor the boy's fear before the revolver
—that will make the ice fall— are absolute truth.
There is a shadow always after the show.
And if it isn't new to die, to live isn't new either.
Suddenly, as I work, eat, walk, Â I encounter the dog's glance.
It interrupts me like two leaves of a tree inside a wound,
like the infantile weeping of a soul that hasn't yet been stepped on,
or of that old woman who, in contrast, scrubs the floor on her knees.
Because it doesn't know how to be resigned, and stealthy
and supplicant —because it doesn't know that it stays resting on its shore—
it leaves me interrupted like a small Romanesque church in a village
or like that rock and its crevices on the side of the shortcut while I continue climbing.
(It leaves me among my elementary texts and I enter,
naturally, studiously united with God in the time
of the imagination still mixing up BÃ©cquer legends with insects).
Or it pierces me with its trusting creature's fear and its excess
of happiness on seeing me (who am a little tough and don't deserve it).
The dog's glance.
Oscar turned twenty years
and he took the decision
of not doing the draft.
It's a singular case,
not a coward neither killer:
just a peaceful boy.
Look that they will condemn you
for traitor and deserter.
—More traitors are who send
the people to the wall,
says Oscar, who didn't forgot.
Nobody thinks that way,
you've lost the mind
—Enough that another loses it
and we will be two finally,
says Oscar. So much illusion.
And the two alone what do you achieve
with such a great stupidity?
—That the death industry
ends once and for all,
says Oscar, how naive he is.
Because two disobey
you believe it will end?
—It won't end completely,
it will start to end.
He's crazy, poor Oscar.
Instead of losing a year
you'll lose the existance.
—Imprisioned or dead I'll have sown
the seed of peace.
Poor Oscar, he's too crazy.
He truned twenty years
and they're coming to get him
form the military draft
But Oscar says no,
I don't learn to kill.
Poor Oscar, he never returned.
We're invited to drink tea
The teapot is of porcelain
but it's not seen.
I don't know why.
The milk is cold
and I'll keep it warm,
I'll put it one of my coats
long till the feet.
Be careful when you drink,
It could fall
the nose in the cup
and that isn't good.
Behind a toast
honey hid.
The butter very angry
reprimanded it in english.
Tomorrow they'll take to jail
a colonel
for poking the marmalade
with a pin.
It seem that the sugar
was always black
and with a scare it turned white
as you see it.
A prudish dish
married the day before yesterday,
His wife the coffee maker
He treats her as usted
The poor strainers
are very thirsty
because the water slips away
everytime
Look at me, I'm happy
among the leaves that sing
when through the garden goes
the wind in a skateboard.
When I go to sleep
I close my eyes and dream
of the smell of a country
in bloom for me.
I'm not a dancer
because I like to stay
steady in the ground and feel
that my feet have roots.
Once I studied
in a little weed book
things only I know
and that I'll never forget
I've learned that a nut
is wrinkled and old,
but it can offer
lots, lots, lots of honey.
I'm a faithful elf of the garden,
when a flower is sad
I paint it with a brush
and I play the bell for it.
I'm a guardian and doctor
of a flower gang
who play domino
and after they cough.
Over here God is going
with a rain watering can
or disguised as the sun
appearing from a balcony
I'm not a great sir,
but in my ground heaven
I keep the best treasure
lots, lots, lots of love
Fine, fine, platinum fish
come to sleep in my sailor hat
Cold, cold pearl of the day
come to fall in my empty boot
A dolphin who plays violin
I'm gonna fish with my sailor fishnet
and the foam of the sea waits for me
to dance crazy of laughter
Old, old ugly crab
come to look at your profile in my mirror
Good, good skinny mermaid
come to enchant my sand palace
Once upon a time
there was a witch in Gulubu
All the population
He put a spell on without rhyme or reason
But one day came the doctor
driving a four-engined jet
And did you know what happened?
No?
All the witchcrafts
of the Gulubu witch
were healed with the vac
with the vaccine 1
The cow of gulubu
couldn't even moo
The witch put a spell on her
and the cow went silent
But then came the doctor
with the vaccine
The children were all
very dunce in Gulubu
They were forgetting the lesson
or they suffer the measles
The witch was the
one and only in Gulubu
who cried, kicked and bit
when the doctor punctured him
And then the doctor left
Do you know what did
the famous Monkey Liso?
At the edge of a trench
he hunted a living orange
How brave he was!
Even if he forgot the knife
and the marmelade jar
he hunted it with a fork.
The orange travels
from the hall to the dining room.
Don't throw me with a knife
throw me with a fork.
At dinner time
he felt pity for the orange,
the Monkey Liso was so good
that he didn't want it as dessert.
The brave hunter
ordered his procession
to keep it alive
in the fridge.
Monkey Liso in the kitchen
with a chinese patience
tamed it everyday,
the orange wasn't learning.
Monkey Liso with rigour
finally pushed it a little
and gave the orange
its first step without mistake
Monkey Liso showed
the orange on the floor.
Other times in visits,
he took it to a cell.
But one day the burglar came in,
you imagine what he did,
The brave Monkey Liso said:
Oh, what a mess
To the king momo court
he went to complain for the robbery.
The liar king promises
that Mr Nobody has it.
Just because, with frenzy
suddenly the monkey says:
There it is behind the throne
the orange I lost
And the queen without permission
of the brave Monkey Liso
hid in a soup bowl
the travelling orange.
Monkey Liso saved it
But by force of tapioca
the orange went crazy
and this tale is over.
Blindfolded mistress
who are at the court
without seeing the lawyers,
get down of your pedestals.
Remove your blindfold and look
how many lie.
Update your scales
and attack with your sword
because without your good functions
we are nothing.
Wash us in blood and ink,
resurrect the innocent
and make the deads bury
the inquiry.
Scare away the black birds,
anhilate the sworms
and may at your feet the men
shake hands.
Illuminate the sleeping judge,
pacify every war
and be forever the queen
of our land.
Blindfolded mistress,
with the scales and the sword
to the fair humiliated men
don't steal the hope.
Admit they're right and cry
because it's time.
Here lies a poor woman,
Who died from exhaustion,
In her life she could never have
Her hands crossed over her lap.1
In this valley of cloth and soap,
I'll go as I have come,
No more luck than the obligation,
Higher pay than oblivion.
Hallelujah, I'm moving to a place,
Where nothing ever gets dirty.
No one will ask me to feed them,
In my final resting place,
I won't have to iron nor sow,
As if I were condemned.
Angels sing 'round,
This eternal scullery maid,
And they change her towel,2
For a crown.
Do not mourn this poor woman,
Because she's on her way,
To a place where there's no sweeping,
Where there's no kitchen.
Hallelujah, this poor
Blessed woman,
She has nothing more to do now,
And she does nothing more now.
Because it hurts if I stay,
But I'll die if I go.
For everything and despite it all, my love,
I want to live in you.
For your decency of life,
For your scandalous sun,
For your summer filled jasmines, my love
Because our childhood language,
Is a secret between us,
Because you mended,
The uprooting in my heart.
For your old rebellions,
And for the age of your pain,
For your endless hope, my love
To play the guitar for you,
To care for you in every flower,
And to hate all those who punish you, my love
Sleep, sleep black child,
Your mother is at the field,
Black Child.
She will bring squails for you,
She will bring delicious fruit for you,
She will bring pork for you,
She will bring lots of things for you.
And if the black doesn't sleep,
The white devil comes
and Zas! eats his leg,
Yakapumba yakapumba,
Apumba yakapumba,
Yakapumba yakapumba.
Working,
Working very hard,
Working, yes,
Working and they don't pay her,
Working and she coughs,
Working and she grieves,
For the small black child,
They don't pay her, yes,
Very hard, yes,
She coughs, yes,
She grieves, yes.
The whirlwinds dance in the sand,
the sun plays in the glitter of the rocky ground,
and attached to the magic of the roads,
the muleteer goes, the muleteer goes.
His poncho to the wind is like a flag of fog,
the flutes of the scrubland salute him,
and encouraging the troop through those hills,
The sorrows and the cows
leave on the same path.
The sorrows are ours,
the cows are aliens.
The sunset shows red-bleeding suns,
the lights of the rocky ground have slept,
and encouraging the troop on and on,
And I hope the night brings a memory
to make my loneliness less heavy.
Like a shadow in the shadow through those hills,
Just because I don't grease those axles
they call me a careless man.
But If I want them to sound,
Why should I grease them up?
Following the tracks all the time
It's too monotonous.
The way becomes too long
when there's nothing to entertain me.
I don't want that silence:
because I had nothing to think about
because I had nothing to think about.
A long time ago I had ...
but now I no longer think
A long time ago I had..
The axles of my cart..
IÂ´ll never grease them up...
Hastening to Granadas gates,
Came oer the Vegas land,
Some forty Gomel horsemen,
And the Captain of the band.
He, entering in the city,
Checkd his white steeds career;
And to a lady on his arm,
Borne weeping many a tear,
Said, Cease your tears, fair Christian,
That grief afflicting me,
I have a second Eden,
Sultana, here for thee.
A palace in Granada,
With gardens and with flowers,
And a gilded fountain playing
More than a hundred showers.
And in the Henils valley
I have a fortress gray,
To be among a thousand queen
Beneath thy beautys sway.
For over all yon winding shore
Extends my wide domain,
Nor Cordovas, nor Sevilles lands,
A park like mine contain.
There towers the lofty palm-tree,
The pomegranates glowing there,
And the leafy fig-tree, spreading
Oer hill and valley fair.
There grows the hardy walnut,
The yellow nopal tall,
And mulberry darkly shading
Beneath the castle wall;
And elms I have in my arcades
That to the skies aspire,
And singing birds in cages
Of silk, and silver wire.
And thou shalt my Sultana be,
My halls alone to cheer;
My harem without other fair,
Without sweet songs my ear.
And velvets I will give thee,
And eastern rich perfumes,
From Greece Ill bring thee choicest veils,
And shawls from Cashmeres looms:
And I will give thee feathers white,
To deck thy beauteous brow,
Whiter than evn the ocean foam
Our eastern waters know.
And pearls to twine amid thy hair,
Cool baths when heats above,
And gold and jewels for thy neck,
And for thy lips be--love!
O! what avail those riches all,
Replied the Christian fair,
If from my father and my friends,
My ladies, me you tear?
Restore me, O! restore me, Moor,
To my fathers land, my own;
To me more dear are Leons towers
Than thy Granadas throne.
Smoothing his beard, awhile the Moor
In silence heard her speak;
Then said as one who deeply thinks,
With a tear upon his cheek,
If better seem thy castles there
Than here our gardens shine,
And thy flowers are more beautiful,
Because in Leon thine;
And thou hast given thy youthful love
One of thy warriors there,
Houri of Eden! weep no more,
But to thy knights repair!
Then giving her his chosen steed,
And half his lordly train,
The Moorish chieftain turnd him back
In silence home again.
I go, fair Nazarene, tomorrow
To queenly Cordova again;
Then thou, my song of love and sorrow
To hear, no longer mayst complain,
Sung to the compass of my chain.
When home the Christians shall return,
In triumph oer the Moorish foe,
My cruel destiny wouldst thou learn?
The history of my loves to know,
The blood upon their hands shall show.
Better it were at once to close,
In this dark tower a captive here,
The life I suffer now of woes,
Than that today thou settst me clear;
Alas! thou sellst it very dear.
Adieu! tomorrow oer, thy slave
May never vex thy soul again,
But vain is all the hope it gave:
Still must I bear the captives chain,
Thine eyes my prison still remain.
Fair Christian! baleful is my star;
What values it this life to me,
If I must bear it from thee far?
Nor in Granadas bowers may be,
Nor, my fair Cordova, with thee?
Todays bright sun to me will seem
A lamp unseasonably by:
Daughter of Spain, thy beauties gleam
Alone my sun and moon on high,
The dawn and brightness of my sky.
Since then I lose thy light today,
Without that light I cannot live!
To Cordova I take my way;
But in the doom my fortunes give,
Alas! tis death that I receive.
A paradise and houri fair
Has Mahomet promised we shall prove:
Aye, thou wilt be an angel there,
And in that blissful realm above
We meet again, and there to love.
Pawing the earth, and snorting in his rage
The Bull is tossing up the torrid sand; 
The while the horseman's eye serene and bland 
Seeks out a point for his red lance to gauge.
Steadied to take the charge, the fight to wage, 
The picador holds his impatient stand; 
His face, for all its blackness, whiter fanned 
To anger as the bull obstructs the stage.
He hesitates; the Spaniard jeers at him; 
He shakes his hornéd front; he tears the earth, 
Heaving great breaths and straining every limb;
The taunter urges him to prove his worth; 
Sudden he charges, fails, and bellows grim, 
His shoulder bleeding, the great crowd in mirth!
